---

This adventure was planned as a single–session adventure (9-11 hours)
for three fifth-level characters:
 - Meriele, a half–elf rogue
 - Elmon, an elf bard
 - Prince Aseir, a human fighter

The adventurers receive a letter begging for them to return to Renaura
to stop the reprehensible events that are disturbing the city.

## Background introduction

This campaign takes place in the region of Ternia in the areas
surrounding the City of Renaura. Ternia exists somewhere the forgotten
realms.

### Elidyr and the Olinarelidyr

Since her escape using her amulet, Elidyr's has been planning to release
great evil on the world as revenge for her prolonged imprisonment. The
characters will remember the symbol on her amulet as a rising sun behind
a dagger pointing down <small>(this was not revealed to the players in
[Unbound](/adventures/unbound/plan/) but the characters will recognise
it)</small>.

![Elidyr's symbol showing a rising sun behind a dagger pointing
down](/images/elidyrs-symbol.svg)

Elidyr works in total secrecy, concealing her location with magic. She
commands two loyal spellcasters *Qa'lir* and *Qa'por*, known to her as
the *Olinarelidyr*. Qa'lir and Qa'por are twins. They are know to common
folk as "The Vanquished Fist". The Olinarelidyr have been tasked with
bringing Ternia under her control. Elidyr communicates with the
Olinarelidyr using sending stones, each carved with Elidyr's
symbol and their own. 

### Qa'lir and Qa'por

The first of the Olinarelidyr, Qa'lir, travelled to Renaura to overthrow
Lord Morcant and place a puppet in his place.

Qa'lir's symbol is a rope burning in the middle. The symbol on the
shared sending stone with Elidyr is shown by a rope burning in the
middle under Elidyr's symbol.

The second, Qa'por, is travelling to bring armies of evil creatures to
Elidyr's side. It's unlikely that the characters will find Qa'por,
though they will find information that will help them find Qa'por in the
future.

Qa'por's symbol is a shattered chain. The symbol on the shared sending
stone with Elidyr is shown by a shattered chain under Elidyr's symbol.

Qa'lir and Qa'por share a sending stone, the symbol shows a shattered
chain and a burning rope in a circle, tied together.

### The City of Renaura

The prosperity of Renaura has now passed. The influence of Qa'lir has
spread corruption in almost all parts of the city.

### The Deposition of Lord Morcant

Qa'lir arrived in Renaura and quickly garnered respect as a rich
merchant with the nobles. She quickly became close to Telnetar,
eventually casting a spell to force Telnetar to do her bidding and
threatening Telnetar's family.

Qa'lir spent the next few weeks building a new guard force for Telnetar.
Buying some of them, threatening some of them, and replacing some by
apprentice spell casters. She personally replaced the old guard captain

Lord Morcant had regular meetings with Telnetar, and Qa'lir used this to
stage the coup. Telnetar, attending this meeting bringing his guards
along, citing a recent attempt against his life, and was allowed to keep
the guards with him.

When the Telnetar and the guards arrived for the meeting in the castle's
parlour, they immediately fought Lord Morcant's guards, attempting to
kill the Lord. Qa'lir and the replaced guards used dark magic during the
fight. Telnetar, realising a flaw in the magic that was binding him to
Qa'lir's magic, told Lord Morcant to flee during the fight. Lord
Morcant, realising the threat, fled with his family.

### The Kidnapping of Telnetar's Family

After Telnetar's disobedience to Qa'lir, Qa'lir ordered Telnetar's
family to be kidnapped to ensure Telnetar's good behaviour.

### Qa'lir in Renaura

Qa'lir's servants are *wights*.

Qa'lir has spies throughout all parts of the city, from beggars to
servants in the remaining noble's houses. It only takes hours for
displays of rebellion to reach the ears of Qa'lir. These spies have been
bribed or threatened by Qa'lir's servants.

### Guards

One of Qa'lir's first director orders through Telnetar as a puppet was
to replace the head of the guard with one of her *wight* servants,
Kexor. One of Kexor's first orders was to kidnap Telnetar's family.

In general, the guards now live in fear of Lord Telnetar and Kexor where
before they were happy to serve. Severe disobedience usually leads to
corporal or capital punishment. The guards are rarely used by the city
government to prevent crime but instead are used to prevent the uprising
of the people.

Guards are rarely punished for villainy and some (roughly 3/10) are
revelling in it.

A rare few very good natured guards (roughly 1/10) will be willing to
help the characters, especially if they see something that makes them
realise the corruption. These guards will usually do it privately
fearing the other guards. Most will be caught at some point.

The remaining guards will follow most commands from their superiors out
of fear.

### Civilians

Crime is now rife in the city, though very little of it is organised.
Qa'lir has killed or threatened most of the gangs within the city.

Between harassment from guards and the rising crime in the city, most of
the civilians are downtrodden. A lot of civilians believe that Telnetar
was just waiting to seize the opportunity to take the city.

### The noble houses of Renaura

There are three noble houses of Renaura. Each have held their family
positions for a long time and have prospered under the rule of the
Morcants.

#### The noble house of Telnetar

The family of Telnetar were some of the earlier supporters of the
Morcant's and have maintained a very close relationship with the crown.
They were a rich merchant family, focussing on rich foods and drinks.

The leader of the Telnetar, Meneri Telnetar is currently controlled by
Qa'lir.

#### The noble house of Farnit

The family of Farnit own multiple mines, ranging from economic metals to
precious metals and stones.

#### The noble house of Pertana

The family of Perthana own a large amount of the land.

## The Letter and Tavern in Jairnt

### The Letter

<blockquote class="letter">

  Meet at the Watcher's Tavern in Jairnt, North of Renaura, on the night
  of the next new moon. There's a matter to discuss that affects many
  people's lives. I can provide you with a significant reward if you
  agree to help. Please be discrete.

  Bring Elmon and Meriele.

</blockquote>

> You've heard news and rumours or a recent deposition of Lord Morcant,
> the old leader of the City of Renaura.

### Outside the tavern

> After a few days of travel, braving the bleak and cold, you've finally
> reached the Watcher's Tavern in the small village of Jairnt, in the
> foothills of the Renau Mountains.
>
> The tavern leans against its neighbours, the tiled roof sagging. Warm
> light spills out of the windows and boisterous chatter emanates,
> inviting you in from the quiet cold and dark. You can smell wood smoke
> and charred meat.

### Inside the tavern

> The moment you open the door, warm air floods out. The must of tobacco
> smoke and spices fill the room, combining with the smoke and charred
> meat. The many merry patrons chatting loudly amongst themselves hardly
> look over, though one shouts, "Get in!  Quickly! You're letting the
> warmth out." A few people keep to the corners, alone and cloaked
> but little attention is paid to them.
>
> The bar has a few people being served at the bar by a young teen boy.

The people in the bar won't know about the petitioner if the characters
ask.

The bar serves cheap wine, reasonable ale, and cider. Some spiced meats
can be served as well.

### The petitioner

> After a few minutes in the tavern, a tall hooded figure wearing a worn
> traveller's cloak approaches from one of the corners. The figure takes
> a chair from a neighbouring table, and places it at yours, immediately
> sitting. The figure, in a graceful voice, says, "Good evening, Prince
> Aseir, Elmond, and Meriele. I'm glad to see that you've answered my
> request to discuss a matter with you."
>
> From the voice, you can tell that this person is unmistakably a woman

The woman's petition to the character's:

> The city's previous leader, Lord Morcant, has been supplanted by Lord
> Telnetar. Telnetar was once the leader of one of the three great noble
> houses in Renaura. The two remaining major noble houses in Renaura
> have stayed quiet and kept to their own business.
>
> It's odd, because Telnetar, when he was a noble was good-hearted and
> sociable. Now, he rarely leaves the castle and gives tyrannical and
> harsh orders to quash any opposition to his rule. The people of the
> city are living and acting out of fear.
>
> My request of you, adventurers, is that you find out what Telnetar is
> doing and put a stop to it. You must stick together and be discrete or
> I think it is likely that you will be doomed to fail.

The petitioner is Juvia, the daughter of Lord Morcant, well versed in
the politics of the city, poised to be the next Lord of the city. She
fled with her father during Telnetar's violent coup, after they saw the
power in their assailants.

She is a 5th-level School of Evocation Wizard. Her intelligence score is
17, intelligence modifier +3, spell save DC 14, spell attack modifier
+6.

The sort of information this person knows:
 - the locations of the nobles' mansions.
 - information about the current nobles and which ones are most likely
   to help the characters.
 - the direction to the city.
 - *reluctant*: her own identity, she fears that, if the characters find
   out who she is, her family may be persecuted. She will explain to the
   characters that she's worried about the knowledge causing harm to
   others if pressed for an answer.
 - *reluctant*: the location of her father, Lord Morcant, and the rest
   of his family.
 - *reluctant*: how she knows the characters, she met them when they
   visited the city and was awed by Prince Aseir's stories.

The characters can identifier her if they succeed on a DC 16
Investigation check, if they have previously met Lord Morcant in his
castle for a banquet. If the characters verbally identify her in a way
that's heard, they will be assaulted on the way to Renaura by five
bandits who demand more information from the characters.

She will give them 100gp each for the troubles so far.


## City of Renaura

### Journey to Renaura

> You're following the road south towards the city, through the forest
> in the foothills of the mountain. The ground is icy and a thin layer
> of snow covers the road. Most of the trees are bare.

> The forest clears after a few miles, showing the bare foothills
> surrounding the City of Renaura which is a few miles away. Though most
> of the city is hidden from you by the surrounding valley, you can see
> the familiar sight of the scarred city walls and a few of the taller
> buildings that are in the lower parts of the city. The city gate is
> open but only a few people are passing in and out of it. Smoke rises
> from some of the chimneys of the homesteads but their farms are quiet.
> A few look to be entirely abandoned.

### Approaching the city

There are eight guards at gate, two on each side, four standing in a
line across the middle. When the characters reach the gate, the guard
closest to the middle on the right will ask the characters to halt and
as what their intentions in the city are.

If the guards think the characters are suspicious, they will let them in
the city but report them to Qa'lir.

### The main street

> Where the main street was previously busy and full of life, only a few
> stalls remain staffed. Sitting in the alleyways and streets are
> beggars.

### The beggar outside the Dragon's Claw

The beggar, as the characters pass the Dragon's Claw, will say "If you
Elmond, a little help for an old friend." It will require a DC 18
Intelligence (Investigation) roll for him to recognise it's the
librarian from the castle. In any case, in exchange for food and drink,
he will promise the characters some information if they will speak in a
private place. If the characters ignore the beggar, he will seek them if
they enter the Dragon's Claw, claiming to the barman that he's returning
an item to the characters that they dropped outside.

In the private place, he will help the will give the characters some
information about the deposition of the old Lord Morcant where the Lord
and his daughter escaped.

### The Dragon's Claw

The mood in the dragons claw is a lot less friendly than the last time.

The barkeep will be happy to serve them. He will try very hard to sell
them on accommodation for the night that would normally be considered
comfortable.

The characters may hear about a recent announcement that a clerk from
the Temple of Ilmater is going to be executed in the morning of the next
day.

### The Temple of Ilmater

A few guards will be in the Temple of Ilmater, arguing with a senior
priest that the characters will recognise as Wurcon.

> "She is a member of the Ilmateri, you have no right to arrest her as
> no other Lord has before," shouts Wurcon.
>
> "Do not blame us for her arrest old man," one of the guards says, "the
> order came direct from Lord Telnetar and it was his own guards that
> captured her. We are only under orders to prepare for her execution."
>
> As Wurcon steps forward angrily, "You must-." The silent guard pushes
> him to the ground and says, "Do not threaten us, there is nothing we
> can do."

Wuron, if helped by the characters, will take the characters to a side
room to explain the recent events regarding their clerk, Glanna. He will
know that Glanna left, saying that she had some temple business at the
Telnetar mansion, though he now thinks that she was up to something.

### Farnit's mansion

If the characters go to Farnit's mansion, they will be informed by
servants that their master is not around. The servant will know where
Farnit is but is reluctant to reveal that information.

### Pertana's mansion

If the characters go to Pertana's mansion, they will find both Farnit
and Pertana "discussing business" in the study. The servants will be
reluctant to let them see the nobles.

The rooms in the mansion are well decorated and it's clear that Pertana
is rich.

Farnit and Pertana will be shocked to be interrupted, will try to hide
all of the documents that they have out, draw weapons and will berate
their servants for interrupting them. They won't attack straight away
but Pertana will begrudgingly ask the players, "What business is so
important that you must interrupt our private meeting?"

> The study is large with books and parchment on large book cases on the
> wall. Wood panelling surrounds the room and it is ornately decorated.
> A fire crackles in the large fireplace.
>
> A portly middle-aged gentleman is looking over parchment and books at
> the desk. An woman is seated, reading out a passage from a book
> intently, "... and the Vanquisher, Faurin, took his own life..."
>
> Hearing you enter the woman throws the book to the ground and quickly
> draws a short sword. The man throws his cloak over the contents of the
> table. The woman shouts, "What is the meaning of this interruption!
> Servants! You were ordered to prevent anybody from entering my study."

If Farnit and Pertana think that the players might be useful or
friendly, given their notoriety, Pertana will give them the following
information:

> "I only impart this knowledge because we, the Watchers, are desperate.
> We are not generals or warriors, just traders and scholars from a
> prosperous city. We have not fought in hundreds of years and we
> wouldn't even know where to start. Many are calling Farnit and I
> apathetic towards the circumstances we face.
>
> "We are not, however, apathetic. We are fighting in our own way.
> Mostly we gather information hoping to find some way of ending the
> tyranny of Telnetar. While we have not found anything that Farnit and
> I can do, I now think there is something the three of you can do.
>
> "The day after Telnetar attacked the castle, a guarded carriage went
> from the castle to his mansion in the dead of night. The guards went
> into his mansion and fighting could be heard there. We saw the guards
> dragging some people out, into the carriages. The carriage didn't go
> back to the castle but instead to one of Telnetar's warehouses.
>
> "The day before last, Glanna (who I think you have met before)
> insisted that the best thing to do was to find out what happened in
> the mansion, as clearly something notable happened that night.
> However, she's not returned and we have heard news that she will be
> executed.
>
> "I fear that we, Farnit and I, have been revealed and that we will
> soon be.
>
> "I implore you to help us find out what happened here. I think it
> might be key to saving this city. Do whatever you think is best here,
> whether that is investigating the mansion, saving Glanna, or investing
> the warehouse."

### Telnetar's mansion

There's a small guard presence outside the front gates of the mansion,
preventing easy access, these guards are under order from the new Lord
to prevent civilians from entering the Lord's mansion, though they don't
know what's inside. The guards will react to loud noises inside the
manor, worrying that they've failed at their job.

Iron fences, 10ft high, with hedges behind them surround the Lord
Telnetar's mansion grounds. The fences are in good condition but the
hedges are.

A few servants lucky to survive have barricaded themselves in the
noble's chambers. This chamber contains the key required to open the
secret entrance to the castle.

#### The grand entrance hall

> What was once clearly a great entrance hall is ruined. Dust, debris
> and dried blood cover most of the surfaces.
>
> A grand staircase is straight ahead, though the top half of it has
> collapsed entirely, revealing a stony dark corridor behind a
> disintegrating wall. Large chunks of the marble banister have fallen
> into the staircase. A large archway opens from the top of the stairs
> to the fist floor but the floor has collapsed where the staircase
> would have ended. Through an arch at the end of the stairs allows you
> to see into a large light room.
>
> A mangled, rotting body is slumped against the far left wall, a
> sword abandoned in its chest. Its stench filling the room.
>
> To both the left and the right of the main door are ornate arches.
> Through the left you can see shattered lounge furniture and through
> the right a gallery, though the artwork lies scattered and torn on the
> floor.
>
> On either side of these arches are collapsed suits of armour, apart
> from to the left off the left door.
>
> From the dark corridor you hear the echoing a woman cry out in pain
> and a deep raspy laugh.

If the characters approach either of the doors, the armour guarding that
door will become animated. These are *Animated Armor* (see page 19 of
the Monster Manual).

If the characters approach the rotting body, the sword in the body will
become animated. This is a *Flying Sword* (see page 20 of the Monster
Manual).

If the characters attempt to climb over the rubble, they will need to
make a DC 13 Dexterity check or otherwise fall down the rubble and down
the stairs.

#### The drawing room

The drawing room has shattered furniture all around. Signs of fighting
are here as well. The door to the dining room is ajar and the characters
can smell rotting food from there.

There is a secret door, leading to the servants' passage, disguised as a
wall on the right wall of the room.

#### The dining room

The stench of rotting food fills this room, the long dining table is on
its side, food all over the floor.

There are two secret doors, both leading to the servants' passage,
disguised as the wall, one on the right side of the room, one on the far
side of the room. The secret door at the far side of the room is ajar.

#### The gallery

> The paintings are torn, frames shattered; the statues broken. At the
> end of the room, there's a barred door which has a couple of broken
> statues barring it shut. Behind the doors you can hear some scratching
> and shuffling.

The barred doors lead to the library.

There is a secret door, leading to the servants' passage, disguised as a
wall on the left side of this room.

#### The library

> This room, like the others lies in ruin. It was once a library, the
> book cases are shattered and the books are on the floor.

There are eight zombies in here, they are all wearing servant's
clothing.

There are two secret doors, both leading the servants' passage,
disguised as the wall, one on the left side of the room, one on the far
side of the room.

#### The servants' passage

> A narrow stone passage.

Where the collapsed wall and stairs are from the mansion's entrance
hall, there are stairs leading downwards; however, the top step is if
you come at the stairs from the other direction.

The passage at the end has a spiral staircase up and three ordinary
doors leading to the servants' quarters. At the top of the spiral
staircase, there is immediately a wooden door. From behind it, shuffling
noises can be heard.

There are plain doors that match up to the secret doors in the drawing
room, the dining room, the gallery, and the library.

#### The servants' quarters

> The beds in this room are scattered, all of the bedding has shredded.
> There's no sign of any movement at all.

#### The kitchen

> The stench of rotting food also fills this room. The preparation
> tables are full of half-prepared food. A large cauldron has been
> knocked over at the far end of the room under a chimney. Ashes cover
> the floor. Pots and pans are scattered everywhere.
>
> There's no sign of any movement in this room.

#### The storeroom

> A room full of barrels but most of the barrels are empty apart from
> some stale bread and a few mouldy apples.

#### The grand corridor

> A long corridor, wider and ornately decorated. At the far end is a
> large window. To the left are three doors, the middle and larger one
> is closed. The others are open. To the right is a large open archway.
>
> In the corridor, four zombies wearing servant's clothing.

From the spiral staircase, the doors on the left hand side (closest to
furthers) lead to the study, master's bedroom, and dressing room.

The door to the master's bedroom won't open if the players try to push
it open. When the players do this, a man's voice from inside will shout
"Wake up! They're trying to get in again!"

The door will take a DC 14 Strength check to open it.

#### The ballroom

> A large ballroom with a large wooden ceiling. On each of the walls are
> two large windows. The broken staircase is at the other end of the
> room.
>
> In the room are another ten zombies wearing servant's clothing.

#### The study

The study is another room full of destruction. The desk is smashed and
there is paper everywhere.

#### The dressing room

The dressing room is another room full of destruction. There is rich
clothes of both lords and ladies scattered around the floor.

#### The master bedroom

> This room, slightly larger than the rooms downstairs, also has ruined
> furniture. A broken four poster bed and chest of drawers are piled
> directly in front of you, moved out of the way to let you through the
> door.
>
> A pile of food is against the left wall, in far left corner is a pile
> of bedding.
>
> To the right of the room there's a large closed chest.
>
> There are four servants and a boy looking tired and bedraggled, their
> clothing torn and soiled: two of the servants are closer to you,
> having moved the furniture; one is sitting on the bedding with the
> boy, the other is standing in guard of the chest.

The four servants in here managed to hide during the fight and then hid
in this room. They hid under the food in the barrels, one of them hid
the chest with them when they saw what was happening.       

In the chest is:
 - a carved ivory statuette
 - a silver and gold broach
 - a ceremonial electrum dagger with a black pearl in the pomel
 - a lute (Doss Lute)
 - a dagger (a Dagger of Venom)
 - a small carved wooden box with an inscription on it

On the small carved wooden box, the inscription says:

<blockquote class="letter">

  In your oath to me, you have bent your knee. Remember this oath, when
  using this key.

</blockquote>

Inside the box is a small orb wrapped in fabric which has an inked map
which shows the castle and its walls and marks a small passage in the
cliff outside the castle walls to the south.

#### The cellar

> The cellar is dim, lit only by a couple of torches.
>
> At the end of the room are are iron barred prison door, both are open.
> To the left of the room is a table.
>
> In the centre of the right of the room is a bound woman and gagged
> woman, she's sobbing. Standing above her is a man ready to strike her.
> His skin is very pale ashy taut skin, he wears dark scaly armour.
>
> At the table are two hooded figures.

The man standing next to her is a wight, the two hooded figures are cult
fanatics.

### Telnetar's warehouse

This is where Telnetar's family is being held captive.

When alley for the entrance of the warehouse is trapped. If the players
trip the wire, they will cause a loud crashing sound that will alert the
guards inside. The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches
between the two walls. A DC to spot the wire is 10. A successful DC 15
Dexterity check using thieves' tools will successfully disable the trap.
Trying without thieves' tools will require a check with a disadvantage.
On a failed check the trap triggers.

There are no guards standing outside the warehouse.

#### Entry room

This small room has some tools for moving boxes and barrels and a small
table with a couple of chairs.

If the trap wasn't triggered, two cultists will be in this room, sitting
at a table. If the players make enough noise, the warehouse defenders in
the first store room will join the fight.

If the trap was triggered, there will be the two cultists plus the
warehouse defenders in the first store room.

There's a door on the opposite side of the room which is barred and
locked (DC 17 strength to unlock it). There's a door to the right that
is open if the characters triggered the trap and closed otherwise. If
the characters make a lot of noise during the fight and the trap hasn't
been triggered then

#### Store room: 1

This room has various luxury wares, it has a door that leads back to the
entry room and another locked door to the left.

This room has two cultists in it and a cultist fanatic. The cultist
fanatic has keys to the prisoners' room (the same key fits both doors).

#### Store room: 2

This store room is filled with large boxes, chests and barrels. There
are five cult fanatics waiting to ambush the players.

#### Prisoners' room

Most of the items have been taken out of this room. There's a table with
a couple of chairs.

In this room there's a cult fanatic who is guarding the prisoners.

The prisoners are a woman and two girls who are all sitting in one of
the corners of the room.

### The public execution of Glanna in the city square

This will occur on the morning of the second day that the characters are
in the city, if the characters haven't saved Glanna.

Her last words will be "From the scripture of Ilmater, 'go to the
Swift's old nest to find the way to the new nest.'"

## The Castle

The castle's wall is guarded by eight guards.

Inside the rest of the castle are various rooms with animated armour,
fanatics and wights.

### Path to the secret entrance

This cave entrance can be seen with a telescope or similar object from
distance.

The characters will have to find a way to get up to the cave entrance
which is 150ft up the cliff or 50ft across the cliff.

If they have the appropriate gear, they will be able to do it without
any checks.

### Cave entrance

> The cave is damp and slippery. It looks like it's been hewn from the
> rock. There is no light and the you can't see the end.

At the end of the passage, the characters can see it open out into the
bridge across the chasm.

### Bridge across the chasm

> From earlier in the passage, you could have mistakenly think this
> opened into a room. It is, however, a huge chasm. On both your side
> and the other side there's a balcony about 50 feet across, with
> balustrades on the sides. Across the middle is a bridge that's 10 feet
> across and about 40 feet long. The bridge doesn't have any railing.
>
> To the left and right of the bridge on both balconies, statues look
> ahead with swords held out.
>
> At the far end is a door, in front of which is a small obelisk.

The statues will wake (Animated Armour) unless the characters bow to
them. If the characters bow to them after they wake, they will return to
their guarding positions.

When the players reach the obelisk:

> The obelisk has a small rounded indent at the top.

The key (the small orb) must be placed on the top of the obelisk for the
door to open. The characters will hear a click when they put it on top
of the obelisk.

Behind the door is a spiral staircase that leads upwards.

### Up to the castle

A spiral staircase takes the characters upwards. When the reach the top
of the spiral staircase, they will reach a wall with a lever. The wall
will have small eye holes that the characters can see through which they
will see by the light coming out of them. They will be able to hear a
man weeping.

The characters will be able to see through the holes in the wall a
throne room, with torches on the wall. A man is on a throne, weeping.

Pulling the lever will cause the wall to slide open, causing a loud
scraping sound.

This wall will reveal the throne room.

### The throne room

> The throne room is set up for dining, full of tables and chairs. There
> is nobody else in the room apart from the weeping man. At the far end
> of the room is a set of double doors.
>
> The scraping noise of the wall opening will cause the man to jump up
> in surprise. He will shout "You shouldn't be here. Leave! Run!"
>
> The moment he shouts that, you hear a loud crack and a cloaked figure
> appears, pushing the man back into his throne. She has a chiseled face
> is obsidian with dark blue streaks and she has white hair. She has a
> symbol of a sun emblazoned on her cloak with a dagger in front of it.
>
> The figure laughs and with an elvish accent says, "Shut up old man."
>
