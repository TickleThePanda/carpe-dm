for three sixth-level characters:
 - Meriele, a half–elf rogue
 - Elmon, an elf bard
 - Prince Aseir, a human fighter

## Introduction

This adventure takes place a week after the events in "The Vanquished
Fist".

Telneter was given passage out of the city with his family in secret
for their safety.

Meeting with the Lord Regent Pertana. She explains that:
 - Remaining wights under Qa'lir's control will wreak havoc. Most of
   them were stationed with the guards and will have been taken down
 - Cultists will flee
 - Constructs will continue to fight but will fight the cultists
 - She is ruling in Morcant's stead

## Outline

It's been a week since the characters freed the city from Qa'lir's
control. They've been paid a very good sum to help with the securing of
the city. Earlier in the week, from the stone, the characters have heard
a shrieking message, "For what you have done Meriele, Elmond, and Aseir,
you will know only pain." This was overheard by others in the castle.

2. Investigate [[TODO: elven village]]
3. Investigate the prophecy
4. Find a way to Elysium

   with the librarian, mentioning his knowledge of the symbol. Players
   speak to the librarian who will point them towards a nearby high elf
   village.
2. Players find that village has been very recently destroyed - there
   are some small fires and smouldering ruins and blood covers the
   streets. There are no bodies but recent monster tracks leading in and
   out of the village. There's very distant screaming. One of the
   buildings with has the mostly destroyed symbol of Elidyr on an
   important building. In that building will be a tapestry with a damage
   version of the prophecy on it. Otherwise, they could track the
   monsters to find the niece of Elidyr and other people in the village.
   Failing that, on returning to the village, they will be hired to
   follow the monsters by Lord Regent Pertana.
4. Players find out that the Blessed Fields are Elysium,
