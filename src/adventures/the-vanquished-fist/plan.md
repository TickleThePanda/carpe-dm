## The Letter

<blockquote class="letter">

  Meet at the Watcher's Tavern in Jairnt, North of Renaura, on the night
  of the next new moon. There's a matter to discuss that affects many
  people's lives. I can provide you with a significant reward if you
  agree to help. Please be discrete.

  Bring Elmon and Meriele.

</blockquote>

> You've heard news and rumours or a recent deposition of Lord Morcant,
> the old leader of the City of Renaura.

## Watcher's Tavern in Jairnt

### Outside the tavern

> After a few days of travel, braving the bleak and cold, you've finally
> reached the Watcher's Tavern in the small village of Jairnt, in the
> foothills of the Renau Mountains.
>
> The tavern leans against its neighbours, the tiled roof sagging. Warm
> light spills out of the windows and boisterous chatter emanates,
> inviting you in from the quiet cold. You can smell wood smoke and
> charred meat.

### Inside the tavern

> The moment you open the door, warm air floods out. The must of tobacco
> smoke and spices fill the room, combining with the smoke and charred
> meat. The many merry patrons chatting loudly amongst themselves hardly
> look over, though one shouts, "Get in!  Quickly! You're letting the
> warmth out." A few people keep to the corners, alone and cloaked
> but little attention is paid to them.
>
> The bar has a few people being served at the bar by a young teen boy.

The people in the bar won't know about the petitioner if the characters
ask.

The bar serves cheap wine, reasonable ale, and cider. Some spiced meats
can be served as well.

### The petitioner

> After a few minutes in the tavern, a large hooded figure wearing a
> worn traveller's cloak approaches from one of the corners. The figure
> takes a chair from a neighbouring table, and places it at yours,
> immediately sitting. The figure, in a graceful voice, says, "Good
> evening, Prince Aseir, Elmond, and Meriele. I'm glad to see that
> you've answered my request to discuss a matter with you."
>
> From the voice, you can tell that this person is unmistakably a woman

The woman's petition to the character's:

> The city's previous leader, Lord Morcant, has been supplanted by Lord
> Telnetar. Telnetar was once the leader of one of the four great noble
> houses in Renaura. Of the four remaining major noble houses in
> Renaura: Shenera was executed for treason a few days after she
> publicly denounced Renaura; the other nobles are still in Renaura but,
> although they once agreed with Shenera, they have stayed quiet and
> keep to their own business.
>
> It's odd, because Telnetar, when he was a noble was good-hearted and
> sociable. Now, he rarely leaves the castle and gives tyrannical and
> harsh orders to quash any opposition to his rule.
>
> My request of you, adventurers, is that you find out what Telnetar is
> doing and put a stop to it. You must do this discretely or I think it
> is likely that you will fail.

The petitioner is the daughter of Lord Morcant, well versed in the
politics of the city, poised to be the next Lord of the city. She fled
with her father during Telnetar's violent coup. after seeing the .

The sort of information this person knows:
 - the locations of the nobles' mansions.
 - information about the current nobles and which ones are most likely
   to help the characters.
 - the direction to the city.
 - *reluctant*: her own identity, she fears that, if the characters find
   out who she is, her family may be persecuted. She will explain to the
   characters that she's worried about the knowledge causing harm to
   others if pressed for an answer.
 - *reluctant*: the location of her father, Lord Morcant, and the rest
   of his family.
 - *reluctant*: how she knows the characters, she met them when they
   visited the city and was awed by Prince Aseir's stories.

She will give them 100gp for the troubles so far.

## Journey to Renaura

> You're following the road south towards the city, through the forest
> in the foothills of the mountain. The ground is icy and a thin layer
> of snow covers the road. Most of the trees are bare.

## City of Renaura

### From a distance

> The forest clears after a few miles, showing the bare foothills
> surrounding the City of Renaura which is a few miles away. Though most
> of the city is hidden from you by the surrounding valley, you can see
> the familiar sight of the scarred city walls and a few of the taller
> buildings that are in the lower parts of the city. The city gate is
> open but only a few people are passing in and out of it. Smoke rises
> from some of the chimneys of the homesteads but their farms are quiet.
> A few look to be entirely abandoned.

### Approaching the city

There are eight guards at gate, two on each side, four standing in a
line across the middle. When the characters reach the gate, the guard
closest to the middle on the right will ask the characters to halt and
as what their intentions in the city are.

the city but report them to Qa'lir.

### The main street

> Where the main street was previously busy and full of life, only a few
> stalls remain staffed. Sitting in the alleyways and streets are
> beggars.

### The beggar outside the Dragon's Claw

This person is familiar to Elmond, it's the librarian from the castle.
He will recognise Elmond as well. In exchange for food and drink, he
will give the characters some relatively accurate rumours about the
deposition of the old Lord and the current goings-on around the castle.

He knows about the fight that happened in the castle and that magic was
used. He will tell the players about the

This is another inn in the city 

### The Temple of Ilmater

A few guards will be in the Temple of Ilmater, arguing with a senior
priest that the characters will recognise as Wurcon. If the characters

of the clerk. If left, it will end with the guards punching the senior
priest and pushing him to the ground, laughing, and then leaving temple.

Wuron, if helped by the characters, will take the characters to a side
room to explain the recent events regarding their clerk, Glanna. He will
know that Glanna realised something from their old records but he won't
know what. She went looking for some more information but was arrested
by guards.
