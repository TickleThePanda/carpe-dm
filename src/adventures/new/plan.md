This adventure was planned as a single–session adventure (9-11 hours)
for three fifth-level players:
 - Meriele, a half–elf rogue
 - Elmon, an elf bard
 - Prince Aseir, a human fighter

The adventurers receive a letter begging for them to return to Renaura
to stop the reprehensible events that are disturbing the city.

## The Letter

> Dear Samir Aseir yi Keltar Yn Caleph Khemed≈,
>
> I sincerely hope that you and your compeers are faring well. I am
> requesting you to help with distressing matters that concern the
> livelihoods of everybody in the city of Renaura.
>
> The City, over the past few months, has not fared well. Our Lord is
> missing and has been replaced with a tyrant, Telnetar. Telnetar and
> thugs have been making threats against many of the nobles of the city.
> One of these threatened nobles has sadly been found murdered in the
> night. Others have since fled the city.
>
> I understand you visited the City of Renaura some months ago. During
> that time, you were paramount to the discovery of the remains of a
> missing librarian's apprentice from the dangerous Tomb of the Last
> Rehani. Your competence in handling dangerous situations has been
> recognised.
>
> Please, return to Renaura with Meriele and Elmond and help us
> overthrow Telnetar.
>
