This adventure was planned as a single–session adventure (9-11 hours)
for three fifth-level players:
 - Meriele, a half–elf rogue
 - Elmon, an elf bard
 - Prince Aseir, a human fighter

The adventurers receive a letter begging for them to return to Renaura
to stop the reprehensible events that are disturbing the city.

## The Letter

<blockquote class="letter">

  Meet at the Watcher's Tavern in Jairnt on the night of the next new
  moon. There's a matter to discuss that affects many people's lives. I
  can provide you with a significant reward if you agree to help.

  Bring Elmon and Meriele.

</blockquote>

## Watcher's Tavern in Jairnt

## City of Renaura


The city's previous leader, Lord Morcant, has been supplanted by
Telnetar.
