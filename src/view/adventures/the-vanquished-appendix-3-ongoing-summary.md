This is the summary of what the players have done over the campaign.
First, there's a brief summary and then a more detailed summary of each.

## Brief summary

The trio met up at a wilderness tower, brought by visions in their
dreams and, for Elmond, by letter. After unlocking the tower, they spoke
to Elydir inside, who tasked them with finding a stolen family amulet
buried in the Tomb of the Last Rehani. They travelled to the City of
Renaura, found out more information about the tomb from the tavern, the
temple, and the library, and found the tomb. In the tomb, they fought
goblins, skeletons, and the ghost of a man, Faurin, to get to the
amulet. They returned the amulet to Elydir and she disappeared, leaving
the gold promised to them behind.

---

Months later, the trio received letters asking them to meet in a tavern
in a town near Renaura. At the tavern, they met a hooded woman who asked
them to take the throne back for Lord Morcant from a tyrannical
supplanter, Lord Telnetar; they agree and travel to Renaura. Here, they:
rescued Glanna and Telnetar's servants from Telnetar's mansion; met
Pertana, leading a small rebellion; and saved a family from a warehouse.
Throughout all of this, they fought sinister creatures and heard of the
unusual and uncharacteristic circumstances under which Telnetar
overthrew Morcant.

The trio then travelled to the castle, using a secret entrance, to find
Telnetar crying at the throne - controlled by a drow mage, Qa'lir. The
symbol of Elydir was emblazoned on her robes, though with a broken chain
below and a broken rope above. They defeated Qa'lir and took a sending
stone from her body, with the same symbol.

---

After helping clean up the city, the characters received a screeching
message from Qa'lir's sending stone, threatening them for what they had
done. Speaking to the castle librarian, they found that the glyph
(apart from the broken chain and rope) is the Glynlamin's family crest.
They live in the elvish village of Aymeluma across the mountain path.

Elmon, Meriele, and Aseir travelled across the mountain path to Aymeluma
in hope of answers about the symbol but found the village mostly
destroyed. In the village, they found the remains of a ruined prophecy
inside a building with Elydir's symbol engraved on it. Nearby, they
discovered an orc camp where elves were trapped in cages who they helped
escape. Speaking to Pharom, an elf who resembled Elydir but younger,
they found out that: the elves' kidnapper was Qa'por; Elydir was
understood to be killed years ago after a grave betrayal; and the full
prophecy text. While the elves travelled to Renaura in search of safety,
the trio, hearing an explosion from the camp, returned to the camp in
hopes of killing Qa'por but failed to reach her before she disappeared
suddenly.

The trio, following the prophecy, travelled to the Cloudpeak Monastery
seeking out "divine slopes". Here, they met Xolbi, a silver dragon who
wanted them to find a stolen crown in return for helping them understand
the meaning of divine slopes in the prophecy. They agreed to help him
and found the crown in Renaura. On returning to Renaura, Xolbi then
explained that a portal will open that night, at the top of Mount Renau
can lead them to Mount Celestia. They set off to immediately. On their
journey up the mountain, they helped a monk reach the top. The monk then
appeared to them as a Deva, and the portal, as silvery pool, opens. The
trio jump into the pool.

## Detailed summaries

These are more detailed summaries of each session.

### Session one: Finding Elydir's amulet
<div class="subheading">5th October, 2018 — Chester</div>

Meriele, Elmon, and Prince Aseir travelled to a wilderness tower.
Meriele and Aseir were brought by their dreams, Elmon invited by
letter. The tower stood alone in a hilly moors with no windows or
doors, apart from the carved outline of a door.

Meriele, Elmon, and Prince Aseir, solved the puzzle the password.
Shouting *Unbind* together unlocked the tower, and followed the
staircase up to the top, where they were welcomed by an elderly elf
called Elydir, in a well furnished office.

Here, she asked them to return a stolen family heirloom, an amulet, to
her. She knew it was in the Tomb of the Last Rehani. She explains that
the amulet has a symbol of the sun setting on it with a dagger facing
down to the horizon. This is in exchange for a reward of 500gp of
treasure and precious stones. She doesn't know exactly where the tomb
is but does know it's near Renaura.

The characters set of to Renaura to see if they could find information
about the tomb. At the city, the characters found clues for the
whereabouts of the tomb:
- the barkeep of The Dragon's Claw warned the trio about goblins that
  used the entrance as a hideout, and that a scholar had gone missing
  recently
- the librarian gave directions to the tomb but that one of his
  apprentices hadn't returned from there recently, asking for them to
  find her
- and the priest, Wurcon, and the temple scholar Glanna, pointed to
  where it was on a map and gave a small amount of history on it.

The characters stayed the night at the castle, meeting some of the
city's higher class before moving out to the tomb.

Arriving at the tomb, they quickly dispatched of the goblins, solved
the door puzzle and then started slowly exploring the tomb, eventually
venturing into the formidable main chamber. In this chamber they found
the slain body of the apprentice and a translation of some of the
rooms in the tomb. Once entering this room, however, they awoke the
skeletons within and were attacked. Managing to fight these off, the
escaped the great chamber.

The character notice that a room on the map has been translated to say
*Faurin, Vanquisher of Elydir*, and recognising choose to travel to
this room.After some more exploration and fighting, they eventually
find Faurin's tomb.

In this room, the characters feel cold and a sense of uneasy sadness
and unfulfillment. After opening the coffin and taking the amulet, the
door to the tomb slams shut. A pale white figure appears between the
characters and the door It said, sorrowfully, ‘That amulet must stay
here. I cannot let you leave with it or knowledge of it. I’m sorry.
I’m sorry.’ The trio defeat this being and leave the tomb.

They return to Elydir's tower after making a copy of the amulet, and
try to give the copy to Elidyir. She demands the proper amulet, and
when it's given to her, disappears instantaneously from the room,
leaving the reward behind.

### Session two: Overthrowing Lord Telnetar
<div class="subheading">26th January, 2019 — Brockweir</div>

The trio parts ways for a few months until an intriguing letter is
sent to each of them, asking for them to meet in the Watchers Tavern
in Jairt, near Renaura.

In this tavern, they meet a woman who talks to them about recent
events in Renaura where Lord Telnetar has supplanted the previous Lord
Morcant and has been tyrannically ruling the city since. She asks them
to find out what Telnetar is doing and to put a stop to it, in
exchange for a reward. The characters accept this and, once again, set
of to Renaura.

They head to the temple and find that Wurcon, the priest, is arguing
with some guards about Glanna being arrested, hearing that she has
been taken to the Telnetar's mansion. Heading there, they kill the
guards outside. Exploring the mansion, they find: Glanna locked up in
the basement, guarded by a wight and two cultists; lots of zombies;
and servants in the bedroom. In the basement, the characters heard the
cultists mention that, during the following day, something was going
to happen, though it wasn't clear what that was.

It's here that they find a small wooden box with an inscription on it,
containing a small orb which was wrapped in a cloth map showing an
alternative way into the castle. 

Glanna takes the trio to Pertana's mansion, a base for the small
rebellion against Telnetar. She explains that, during one of the first
nights that Telnetar had become the leader, his family had been taken
from the mansion. Rather than being taken to the castle, as expected,
they were taken to a warehouse.

Pertana convinced the characters to go to the mansion in an attempt to
rescue the family, hoping they might be able to find out more
information about what happened to the city. The *warehouse incident*
happened.

After this, the trio travelled to the castle, using the clifftop
entrance to get in. Arriving in a large cave with a bridge across a
ravine with a door on the other side. Statues animate when they try to
cross the bridge and they realise they must kneel to be let past. At
the far end, they use the orb from the small wooden box, to unlock the
doors. Behind the doors are stairs.

The trio follow the stairs up where they arrive in a small, dark room,
from which they can see through small slits in the wall into the
throne room. In the throne room, they can hear a man weeping. They
open a door to the throne room using a lever. When the man sees them,
he stands and shouts “You shouldn’t be here. Leave! Run!”

As this happens, a figure appears and pushes him back onto his chair.
She had a obsidian skin with dark blue streaks with a finely chiseled
face on her cloak she had a symbol of a sun with a dagger in front of
it emblazoned on her cloak, much like the one on Elydir's amulet. She
introduces herself as Qa'lir. Although the trio face a lot of powerful
spells, an imp, and a cloud of poison, they manage to defeat her,
though with only Meriele standing, who deals the final blow.

Meriele loots Qa'lir's body, taking diamonds and a stone engraved with
Elydir's symbol, a broken chain also engraved underneath it.

### Session three: Finding the prophecy
<div class="subheading">8th November, 2019 — Chester</div>

After spending the last week killing the monster, constructs, and
cultists which remained in the city, the characters met with Pertana.
During the meeting, they receive as screaming message from the stone
taken from Qa'lir's body which Meriele had kept secret until now -
threating them for what they had done.

Elmond suggests that they speak with the castle librarian, where they
find that the stone is a *sending stone*. Additionally, he identifies
the main symbol on the stone as the symbol of the Glynlamin family and
their historic relations between them and the Rehani. The elvish
village of the Glynlamin is across the mountain pass.

The characters took a short rest in the Dragon's Claw for some food
and sleep - Meriele avoids people, Aseir tries to rendezvous with
Glanna, and Elmon performs for the occupants. Then, after finding some
winter gear from Cheda and finding rumours about Aymeluma which there
were little of them to tell, they travelled across the mountain pass -
fighting with wolves.

Once across the other side, they saw the village in the distance.
Smoke and blood - not good. Aseir rode on ahead to the decimated empty
village and Meriele looked out, climbing a tree. Together, Aseir and
Meriele saved a young elvish child, terrified of the monsters that took
her family. Elond explored a building marked with the symbol of
Elydir, finding a half destroyed poem on the walls.

Hearing distant shouting, the characters headed out in search. They
found the source, an Orcish campsite, a lavish tent marked with the
symbol of Elydir guarded. Cages filled with elves were beside the camp,
one of the elves looking strikingly similar to Elydir. Elmond tricked
most of the orcs way with illusions and Aseir and Meriele killed the
rest of the orcs. They freed the elves and Elmond left an illusion of
tents behind. Meriele looked into the tent but didn't find out much
information, and then returned to the village with the others.

The party organised an escape for the elves from their village to
Renaura. Speaking to the elf that looked like Elydir, the characters
find out that Elydir was understood to be killed years ago after a grave
betrayal. The elf gave the party the full prophecy of which they had
found a part. They find out the name of their kidnapper - Qa'por.

Hearing shouting and screaming in the distance, from the orc camp, the
characters returned, ready to fight Qa'por. They arrived at the camp,
burning, orcs dying at a single word from Qa'por. Before the characters
could react, she disappears.

Following the prophecy, the characters hashed out a plan to travel up to
the mountain, to the Cloudpeak Monastery, in seek of divine slopes. They
rested for the night in the ruins of the village and headed up the
mountain the following day.

After a long journey, they reached the cloudpeak monastery, initially
appearing derelict. They meet Xolbi and find out he is a silver dragon.
He understands the meaning of "divine slopes" in the prophecy, but will
only help them if they first find a stolen crown.

The characters are teleported back to Renarua by Xolbi, also providing
the glyphs to return. With the help of Meriele, the characters found the
thieves who stole the crown and return to the Cloudpeak Monastery,
teleported by Wurcon - though not before Aseir was rejected by Glanna,
yet again.

Returning the crown to Xolbi, he let them know that a portal will open
that night to Mount Celestia, at the top of Mount Renau. He keeps the
weather calm to help them travel up the mountain.

On the way up, they met a monk who had fallen while on his pilgrimage to
the top. They help him up the hill, letting him take a horseback.
Reaching the top, the characters waited until the moon was overhead.

As the moon reached its peak, the wind calm and the air warmed - a
silvery pool appeared. The monk transformed into a Deva and thanked the
characters for their help, before letting them pass into the portal.

The characters, hand in hand, jumped into the pool together,
apprehensive of what they might find on the other side.
