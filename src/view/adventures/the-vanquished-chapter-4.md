## Silver Sea

> You have just jumped through the shimmering portal atop Mount Renau. A
> silvery sea is only 50 feet below.
>
> Pleasant warm air, a sticky contrast to the bitter mountain air,
> rushes past you, as you hurtle towards a Silvery Sea, the light from
> stars and moon shimmering on the surface.
>
> In the few seconds that you have in the air, you catch a few glimpses
> of your surroundings:
> - an impossibly large mountain island with a sprawling shore of
>   glowing warm lights and tall white buildings
> - two distant tall-ships, one in the North West and one towards the
>   south
> - a small ornate ship with beautiful sails, only a few hundred feet
>   away to the south west.
>
> You each take 5d6 bludgeoning damage as you hit the water. You're
> plunged under by the force and your heavy mountain clothing and
> equipment weight you down. Make a strength save (DC 15) to try to stay
> afloat. The water is, surprisingly, clear, fresh, and sweet - not
> salty.

If the players make enough noise and movement, a whale will come along
and help the players stay afloat, coming from below, and the nearby
ornate ship with beautiful sails will also move to help them.

As the ship approaches:
> The small ornate ship is close by, approaching you slowly, its hull
> and cabins are intricately carved, depicting the sea and oceanic
> nature.  Its silken sails softly swell in the gentle breeze. Most of
> the light on the deck comes from candles and lanterns but you also see
> a couple of small balls of light zooming around above the ship. A
> short inscription on the side of the ship but you can't understand it
> *(unless a character can read celestial)*.
> 
> You can see five elves on the deck: two elf-women dressed in white and
> gold embroidered trousers and shirts - the first, clearly the captain,
> is standing at the ship's wheel giving calm orders to the other - the
> second is carrying them out; the three other elves, two men and a
> woman, are in white and gold robes, intently watching everything
> that's going on.
>
> The captain waves over to you and gives another order. The ship slows,
> most of the deck now eclipsed by the approaching side. The working elf
> approaches the edge and throws down a rope ladder. The two balls of
> lights appear behind her, flittering excitedly, melodically
> chattering.
>
> The captain approaches the edge - briefly bringing her index and
> middle fingers up to each of her eyes, closing them, and bowing. "I
> regret that I can't greet you properly. You are welcome aboard into
> safety, Any-kin."

### The Lunar Allure

This is a small pleasure cruise ship for people looking for
enlightenment through finding beauty in the world.

There are 6 elves aboard:
 - the ship's captain, Beiren To-kin
 - the ship's crewmember, Dordan To'Il-kin
 - three Addan To'Il'Ty-kin, Yellar To'Ty-kin, and Ianfir To'Lath-kin
 - a disguised Arcalaloth, Mogthodoth, known as Banir Any-kin to the
   other elves aboard

> As you climb aboard, you see the well lit deck, clean, tidy, and well
> ordered. The ship barely sways above the water. The two balls of light
> flitter around you, continuing to chatter. You notice another elf,
> hooded in blue and grey robes with orange ornate threading, sitting
> quietly on a clutching a green travellers pack closely.
>
> The captain bows again, greeting you in the same way as before: "I,
> Beiren To-kin, welcome you to my vessel, the Lunar Allure. This is
> Dordan To'Il-kin *(gesturing to the working elf)*, and these are Addan
> To'Il'Ty-kin, Yellar To'Ty-kin, and Ianfir To'Lath-kin *(gesturing to
> the other elves who bow)*. Over there *(gesturing to the sitting elf)*
> is Banir Any-kin. What may I call you three travellers?"

He will welcome the characters aboard. He will tell them that Banir is
also a traveller.

#### Beiren To-kin

He seeks beauty in this world will to help him and others achieve
goodness. The safety of his ship, its crew, and his passengers are the
utmost importance. He has the desire for ordinary worldly things which
he struggles to abstain from.

He will be willing to give passage to the land and a change of clothes
if they wish.

He will allow for the ship to be boarded by the Moon's Gaze if requested
but he will appear nervous because of his deal with Banir Any-kin.

#### Dordan To'Il-kin, Addan To'Il'Tyr-kin, Yellar To'Tyr-kin, and Ianfir To'Lath-kin

These are friendly elves who will talk about the beauty they have seen
so far on their journeys.

#### Banir Any-kin

An Arcanaloth in disguised as a fair elf, Banir Any-kin, using the
*Alter Self* spell. In his pack are dark tomes, spell scrolls, and dark
arcane components. 

He seeks knowledge and believes that it will lead him to power and self
agency. During his travels, he has been in search of the Lost Book of
Keeping that contains his name. When he sees something that is magical
or full of knowledge, he can't think of anything else other than how to
get it.

He has taken a long and difficult journey to Lunia to find [Ith, the Orb
of Empathy][ith] for Elydir, in exchange for access to the libraries. He
knows that Faurin's location and that he has knowledge of where Ith is.

Already exhausted, if the players speak to him, he will show a very
brief flash of annoyance which any character who makes a successful
check against a Wisdom (Insight) DC 19 will see. He will then politely
give the reason to being here is to trade with people in *Hearts Faith*.

He has bribed the captain to hide him from any patrol ships that move
nearby, paying him with an old copy of a common novel.

If he comes to learn who the characters are, he will try to use them and
their knowledge to reach the weapon.

#### Lantern Archons

These will flit around the characters asking for them to "play" - they
want to hear music from these outsiders. As the music
plays, they will modulate their colours and flash along to it.

Once they're bored, they will fly to one of the larger patrol ships,
*The Moon's Gaze*, to share the news on newcomers. 

### The Moon's Gaze

This is a large patrol ship crewed by Archons. The captain is a Warden
Archon, the crew is Hound Archons. A Trumpet Archon is around in case a
message needs to be taken to the city. A few Lantern Archons will fly
around.

This ship will approach the Lunar Allure if the Lantern Archons from the
ship approach it and board the Lunar Allure, which *Beiren To'kin* will
allow, though he seems a little nervous.

The Trumpet Archon will greet Beiren and ask that any newcomers to Mount
Celestia are transferred to their custody. Beiren will be surprised
about this as its abnormal. The conversation will go quiet and a few
seconds later Beiren will nod.

He will ask the player characters if they are happy to be transferred
across to the Moon's Gaze.

## City of Heart's Faith

This is the largest city in Mount Celestia. Ships that arrive here land
at the Port of Wonders.

> A city of towering polished marble shimmers in the starlight.
> Lanterns, candles, and balls of light add to the radiance of the city,
> giving an inviting warm glow. Beautiful gardens fill much of the space
> in the city both in the depths of the city and on the peaks of the
> towers.
> 
> Yet, despite its size, the city is wholly dwarfed by the mountain
> beyond. Its size incomprehensible. Its lowest slopes disappear into
> the sky above. Between the lower hills, valleys and passes, stone
> pathways are lit by ornate lamps.

Throughout the city, there are various Archons who may stop the
characters and ask for their identification or details of their
registration. If they haven't been registered, they will be taken to the
Hall of Salutation to be greeted.

### Port of Wonders

This is the largest port in Heart's Faith and therefore in the whole of]
Lunia. Most of Lunia's trade moves through this city.

> Marble wharfs, small and large, strut out from a towering marble city.
> Two other large patrol ships are docked to the largest wharf. Across
> the others are a couple of ornamental ships and other slightly larger
> ships.
>
> It's busy but strangely calm. Around the slightly larger ships, people
> are moving cargo back and forwards, stacking the cargo carefully on
> the wharf or on the ships.

If the players arrive here via one of the patrol ships, they will be
escorted to the Hall of Salutation.

### Hall of Salutation

Any strangers caught by Archons who are not registered will be brought
here. They will be cared for carefully, in preparation to meet the
Planetar. This is one of the measures taken to prevent a demon invasion.
The attendants are careful due recent invasions.

The Planetar will check the player characters form to ensure that they
are not humans.

### Temple to Ilmater

A large temple to Ilmater.

### Temple to Torm

A large temple to Torm.

### Temple to Tyr

A large temple to Tyr.

### Lesser shrines

There are lesser shrines throughout the city.

## Hope's Ingress

This is where new souls enter Mount Celestia.

The administrators here know Faurin's location and will warn the player
characters that they will not be allowed entrance, as they have not
passed and are not in need of the Cave of Starts.

## Cave of Stars

A tranquil monastery built into the mountain, into a cave of luminescent
gems. Many of those, who still mourn their lives or losses travel here
to meditate in peace.

A main gate is guarded by a hound Archon, Drammer. He is under orders to
guard the entrance and to allow pre-agreed creatures into the monastery.
These must be checked with the monastery administrator on the
presentation. He is a loyal guard and follows these orders without
question or hesitation - even if that means that he needs to check that
somebody is on the list more than once.

### Faurin's abode

Faurin rests here in the cave of stars.

He knows about Elydir's old plans and her want to combine the pieces of
the Staff of Skonarith.

## Temple of Affinity

This is where the Ith has been kept safe.

## Encounters

 - Deep pass and a corrupted lanterns
 - Priest who will not let the characters pass due to not good/lawful
 - Nycanloth tracking the characters
