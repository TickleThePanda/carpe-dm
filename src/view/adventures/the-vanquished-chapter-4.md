## Introduction

On the second day, the players will receive a taunting message on the
sending stone: "You are fools to leave at such a time."

## Silver Sea

> You have just jumped through the shimmering portal atop Mount Renau. A
> silvery sea is only 50 feet below.
>
> Pleasant warm air, a sticky contrast to the bitter mountain air,
> rushes past you, as you hurtle towards a Silvery Sea, the light from
> stars and moon shimmering on the surface.
>
> In the few seconds that you have in the air, you catch a few glimpses
> of your surroundings:
> - an impossibly large mountain island with a sprawling shore of
>   glowing warm lights and tall white buildings
> - two distant tall-ships, one in the North West and one towards the
>   south, well lit
> - a small ornate ship with beautiful sails, only a few hundred feet
>   away to the south west.
>
> You each take 5d6 bludgeoning damage as you hit the water. You're
> plunged under by the force and your heavy mountain clothing and
> equipment weight you down. Make a strength save (DC 15) to try to stay
> afloat. The water is, surprisingly, clear, fresh, and sweet - not
> salty.

If the players make enough noise and movement, a whale will come along
and help the players stay afloat, coming from below, and the nearby
ornate ship with beautiful sails will also move to help them.

As the ship approaches:
> The small ornate ship is close by, approaching you slowly, its hull
> and cabins are intricately carved, depicting the sea and oceanic
> nature.  Its silken sails softly swell in the gentle breeze. Most of
> the light on the deck comes from candles and lanterns but you also see
> a couple of small balls of light zooming around above the ship. A
> short inscription on the side of the ship but you can't understand it
> *(unless a character can read celestial)*.
> 
> You can see five elves on the deck: two elf-women dressed in white and
> gold embroidered trousers and shirts - the first, clearly the captain,
> is standing at the ship's wheel giving calm orders to the other - the
> second is carrying them out; the three other elves, two men and a
> woman, are in white and gold robes, intently watching everything
> that's going on.
>
> The captain waves over to you and gives another order. The ship slows,
> most of the deck now eclipsed by the approaching side. The working elf
> approaches the edge and throws down a rope ladder. The two balls of
> lights appear behind her, flittering excitedly, melodically
> chattering.
>
> The captain approaches the edge - briefly bringing her index and
> middle fingers up to each of her eyes, closing them, and bowing. "I
> regret that I can't greet you properly. You are welcome aboard into
> safety, Any-kin."

### The Lunar Allure

This is a small pleasure cruise ship for people looking for
enlightenment through finding beauty in the world.

There are 6 elves aboard:
 - the ship's captain, Beiren Ty-kin
 - the ship's crewmember, Dordan To'Il-kin
 - three Addan To'Il'Ty-kin, Yellar To'Ty-kin, and Ianfir To'Lath-kin
 - a disguised Arcalaloth, Mogthodoth, known as Banir Any-kin to the
   other elves aboard

> As you climb aboard, you see the well lit deck, clean, tidy, and well
> ordered. The ship barely sways above the water. The two balls of light
> flitter around you, continuing to chatter. You notice another elf,
> hooded in blue and grey robes with orange ornate threading, sitting
> quietly on a clutching a green travellers pack closely.
>
> The captain bows again, greeting you in the same way as before: "I,
> Beiren Ty-kin, welcome you to my vessel, the Lunar Allure. This is
> Dordan To'Il-kin *(gesturing to the working elf)*, and these are Addan
> To'Il'Ty-kin, Yellar To'Ty-kin, and Ianfir To'Lath-kin *(gesturing to
> the other elves who bow)*. Over there *(gesturing to the sitting elf)*
> is Banir Any-kin. What may I call you three travellers?"

He will welcome the characters aboard. He will tell them that Banir is
also a traveller.

#### Beiren Ty-kin

He seeks beauty in this world will to help him and others achieve
goodness. The safety of his ship, its crew, and his passengers are the
utmost importance. He has the desire for ordinary worldly things which
he struggles to abstain from.

He will be willing to give passage to the land and a change of clothes
if they wish.

He will allow for the ship to be boarded by the Moon's Gaze if requested
but he will appear nervous because of his deal with Banir Any-kin.

#### Dordan To'Il-kin, Addan To'Il'Tyr-kin, Yellar To'Tyr-kin, and Ianfir To'Lath-kin

These are friendly elves who will talk about the beauty they have seen
so far on their journeys.

#### Banir Any-kin (Morcanloth)

An Arcanaloth in disguised as a fair elf, Banir Any-kin, using the
*Alter Self* spell. In his pack are dark tomes, spell scrolls, and dark
arcane components. 

He seeks knowledge and believes that it will lead him to power and self
agency. During his travels, he has been in search of the Lost Book of
Keeping that contains his name. When he sees something that is magical
or full of knowledge, he can't think of anything else other than how to
get it.

He has taken a long and difficult journey to Lunia to find [Ith, the Orb
of Empathy][ith] for Elydir, in exchange for access to the libraries. He
knows that Faurin's location and that he has knowledge of where Ith is.

Already exhausted, if the players speak to him, he will show a very
brief flash of annoyance which any character who makes a successful
check against a Wisdom (Insight) DC 19 will see. He will then politely
give the reason to being here is to trade with people in *Hearts Faith*.

He has bribed the captain to hide him from any patrol ships that move
nearby, paying him with an old copy of a common novel.

If he comes to learn who the characters are, he will try to use them and
their knowledge to reach the weapon.

#### Lantern Archons

These will flit around the characters asking for them to "play" - they
want to hear music from these outsiders. As the music
plays, they will modulate their colours and flash along to it.

Once they're bored, they will fly to one of the larger patrol ships,
*The Moon's Gaze*, to share the news on newcomers. 

### The Moon's Gaze

This is a large patrol ship crewed by Archons. This ship is patrolling
and watching for planar travellers so that they can be examined by the
Mydaiel the Planetar in Hearts Faith.

The captain is a Warden Archon, Beornheard. He is stern and his
concentration will always lie elsewhere, watching and giving orders. A
Trumpet Archon, Sonaru, is around in case a message needs to be taken to
the city. It speaks with an androgynous musical voice, clear and loud. A
dozen Hound Archons will work hard crewing the ship but will be
reluctant to the players, ignoring them if possible. Tens of Lantern
Archons will flit around the ship, chattering away. They will be asked
to leave the players alone if they're too distracting.

This ship will approach the Lunar Allure if the Lantern Acheron's have
warned them that there are planar travellers.

> A larger ship approaches, your eyes are drawn to its figurehead - in
> the shape of Tyr - a muscular man, pits where there should be eyes,
> with a warhammer held forward. Behind this, larger masts and sails. It
> turns and slows to move alongside the *Lunar Allure*.
>
> Standing at the captains wheel is an armoured bear-like humanoid
> watching carefully. Floating beside this creature is a tall winged
> pearlescent green creature, similar in features to an elf, holding a
> large trumpet. A dozen hound-headed muscular human like creatures crew
> this ship. Tens of the small balls of light flit around.
>
> When it comes to a stop, a couple of the small balls of light zoom
> over chattering "friends, friends." *Beiren To'kin* fidgets and stand
> nervously glancing around the ship.
>
> The winged creature flies across to the Lunar Allure, greeting Beiren
> Ty'kin in the same fashion as Beiren did to you earlier, giving
> *Sonaru* as its name. Sonaru says, "Our lights have warned us that
> you have picked up planar travellers.  Please, allow them to come with
> us so that they may have an audience with Mydaiel."
>
> Beiren takes a deep breath and shakily responds, "th-these three
> arrived just moments ago."
>
> He looks like he's about to say something else but then he turns to
> you to say, "My friends, will you travel with them?  I promise they
> mean you no harm, this is rare matter of formality."

## City of Hearts Faith

This is the largest city in Mount Celestia. Ships that arrive here land
at the Port of Wonders.

> A city of towering polished marble shimmers in the starlight.
> Lanterns, candles, and balls of light add to the radiance of the city,
> giving an inviting warm glow. Beautiful gardens fill much of the space
> in the city both in the depths of the city and on the peaks of the
> towers.
> 
> Yet, despite its size, the city is wholly dwarfed by the mountain
> beyond. Its size incomprehensible. Its lowest slopes disappear into
> the sky above. Between the lower hills, valleys and passes, stone
> pathways are lit by ornate lamps.

Throughout the city, there are various Archons who may stop the
characters and ask for their identification or details of their
registration. If they haven't been registered, they will be taken to the
Hall of Salutation to be greeted.

### Port of Wonders

This is the largest port in Hearts Faith and therefore in the whole of]
Lunia. Most of Lunia's trade moves through this city.

> Marble wharfs, small and large, strut out from a towering marble city.
> Two other large patrol ships are docked to the largest wharf. Across
> the others are a couple of ornamental ships and other slightly larger
> ships.
>
> It's busy but strangely calm. Around the slightly larger ships, people
> are moving cargo back and forwards, stacking the cargo carefully on
> the wharf or on the ships.

If the players arrive here via one of the patrol ships, they will be
escorted to the Hall of Salutation.

### Streets of Hearts Faith

> The streets are busy, mostly humans, elves, dwarves, and halflings
> garbed in white. They walk quickly and orderly, politely moving aside
> for others. They go in and out of the shrines, gardens, and houses.
> Occasionally, a band of Hound Archons will pass by, or a Trumpet
> Archon will fly overhead. A Deva, like the one seen at the top of the
> mountain, is flying overhead. A few merchants and travellers are
> dressed in more unusual clothes, walking towards or away from the port
> and into Taverns.

### Hall of Salutation

Any strangers caught by Archons who are not registered will be brought
here. They will be cared for carefully, in preparation to meet the
Planetar, Mydaiel. This is one of the measures taken to prevent a demon
invasion. The attendants are careful due recent invasions.

> The Hall of Salutation is a lofty marble building shaped like an
> obelisk, over 800ft tall. Around the building are balconies in an
> alternating pattern on each floor and open windows. Out of the
> balconies and windows grow beautiful plants and flowers draping and
> ivies growing up the walls. Near the top is a huge stained glass
> window of the Triad.
>
> Hound Archons guard the entrance, a portico with an archway behind it.
> A few merchants and travellers are entering here, escorted by other
> Archons. A few merchants and travellers are exiting.

If the characters are escorted here or seek an audience with Mydaiel,
they will be taken through *The Entrance Hall and Staircases*, up to a
*Lounge*. 

#### The Entrance Hall and Staircases

> The entrance portico leads to a tunnel with rooms coming off either
> side. Additional Hound Archons guard the entrance. Each room has many
> Archons of different types working: studying, sparring, or conversing.
> The tunnel ends in a large room in which a staircase spirals up centre
> of the building.
>
> There are 44 floors. On every floor there are more tunnels and rooms,
> though fewer guards.

At the top of the staircase:
> At the top of the staircase, there are rooms on all sides except the
> south where there's a grand staircase. It has thick red carpets with
> elaborate patterns up the middle. Rather than spiralling, this
> staircase heads up from the centre and back on itself. In some of
> these rooms that you can other travellers and merchants. An angelic
> voice booms from above, the room vibrates and sings with it.

#### Rooms

For a room that the players enter, roll a d100 and consult the table
below.

Result | Type
--- | ---
1-5 | A kitchen, roll 1d4 for the number of Hound Archons
6-10 | A watch room, a Warden Archon will be in here
11-20 | A training room, roll 1d8+2 for the number of Hound Archons in this room
20-50 | A study, roll 1d4 for the number of Hound Archons and 1d4 for the number of Trumpet Archons
50-100 | A communication room, roll 1d8 for the number of Hound Archons and for the number of Trumpet Archons

#### The Lounge

> A table is set out with fine foods and drinks. There's an area to sit.
> A large balcony towers looks out over the city and sea. Out of vast
> pots, plants cascade over the side and ivies up the wall, their leaves
> the size of dinner plates and branches as thick as arms.

If brought to the lounge, they will be left alone asked to wait, which
will be about 20 minutes.

The balcony is 660ft in the air, there are 22 balconies below it, each
30 ft apart.

#### The Hall of Mydaiel the Patient

> Up the final set of stairs, you are led into a grand hall, the ceiling
> over 100ft tall. A huge stained glass window depicting the Triad
> sparkles in the starry Lunia light. Sitting in a huge throne atop a
> large set of stairs is a 9 foot tall, a handsome muscular winged
> creature with opalescent emerald skin. A large sword, still in its
> scabbard, leans against the throne.
>
> A Trumpet Archon floats aside and Hound Archons are positioned at the
> bottom of the stairs and by the entrance you just entered through.

Mydaiel the Patient is a *Planetar* who serves the Triad. He is there to
make sure that those in Lunia are not fiends or elementals and don't
mean any harm to the land. He will use his *truesight* to see creatures
original forms. He will question visitors about their intent in Lunia,
using his *Divine Awareness* to tell if a creature is lying. He knows
that the administrators at Hope's Ingress will know whether any creature
has arrived here after dying and may know where they are.
### Temple to Torm

A large temple to Torm.

### Temple to Tyr

A large temple to Tyr.

### Lesser shrines

There are lesser shrines throughout the city.

## Hope's Ingress

This is where new souls enter Mount Celestia.

The administrators here know Faurin's location and will warn the player
characters that they will not be allowed entrance, as they have not died
and are not in need of the Cavern of Starts.

## Cavern of Stars

A tranquil monastery built into the mountain, into a cave of luminescent
gems. Many of those, who still the many who mourn their lives or losses
travel here to meditate in peace. Only those given permission by a
Planetar, Mydaiel, can enter into the Cavern of Stars.

It is staffed by Hound Archon's, who act as caretakers, guards, and
administrators of the monastery. There are two guards, three caretakers,
and one administrator.

Silence is expected in the Cavern of Stars, though telepathic
communication and non-verbal communication is allowed. The patients are
likely to report anybody unexpected to the Hound Archons, though this
won't be taken seriously immediately because of how unexpected and
unlikely it is.

Any visitors who break these rules will be asked to leave by the Hound
Archons, though only the guards will show force, and even that will only
be in the most dire of situations. The Hound Archons will alert
superiors if anybody breaking the rules appears.

The inside of the Cavern of Stars is *Hallowed*. Celestials are excluded
from the normal effects. In addition, bright light fills the area.
Magical darkness created by spells of a lower than level 8 can't
extinguish the light.

#### Cavern of Stars Interior

In the deeper interior, the corridors and rooms have the following
description
> The walls and floors are the same material as the outer cave but are
> polished instead. Carvings with markings filled with gold, and painted
> murals cover the walls depicting peaceful vistas and godly figures.
> Occasionally, there is a statue of an angel or other angelic being.

### The Grand Doorway

> The path is steep up the mountain. To your right, a steep valley with
> a river flowing through it; the river flows from out of a cave below -
> a light shining out of it.
>
> At the end of the path, large marble doors are built into the cliff.
> Two angelic statues stand beside the door, holding their swords over
> the doorway. A large garden is built around the doorway and statues,
> filled with small water features, benches and chairs.
>
> Just in front of the marble doors, a single Hound Archon is standing
> guard.

A main door is guarded by a Hound Archon, Drammer. He is under orders to
guard the entrance and to allow pre-agreed people into the monastery.
These must be checked with the monastery administrator on their arrival.
He is a loyal guard and follows these orders without question or
hesitation, though perhaps a little too the letter.

Morcanloth may be "resting" in the gardens in a new disguise, if he
reaches the Cavern of Stars before them.

> Behind the large doors, you can see a corridor. Bright light, as if it
> was a bright summer's day, shines out from inside. Deeper inside, it
> glistens.

This doorway leads to the [Balcony of Joy](#balcony-of-joy).

### Balcony of Joy

> You walk into a marble entrance hall and out onto a huge white stone
> balcony that overlooks an immense cavern. The cavern's surface is
> covered in sparkling stones and iridescent gems. Millions of pinpricks
> of light shine upon you from the walls - though you can't see a light
> source. The cavern is roughly circular, about 100ft across in all
> directions, except to the east where it opens out through a natural
> arch.
>
> Straight ahead, to the north, a huge natural pillar, shining like
> everything else, rises from the bottom of the cavern. Around the
> pillar is a marble platform - another garden, somebody tending to it.
> A bridge crosses from the balcony you're on across to the central
> platform.
>
> Across to the north-east there's a smaller balcony, tables and chairs
> are laid out. This balcony is separate with no visible pathways to it.
>
> To your left, the balcony narrows to a path around the edge of the
> cave, reaching a door on the far-west side of the cavern. Another
> bridge spans from this door across to the central pillar.
>
> To your right, a marble stairway follows around the edge of the
> cavern, downwards. In the area 50ft below the balcony, a few people
> are sparring with wooden swords, spears, and staffs. To the east,
> below the huge archway, is a large silvery lake, a river flows from
> this out of the cavern, below you, to the south, a bridge crosses it.
>
> Immediately to your left, in the entrance hall, is a marble doorway.
>
> The only sound you here is the water flowing and the wood weapons
> hitting each other.

If the players are in sight of the door across the other side of the
cavern:
> Hidden behind the central pillar, you can now see an additional bridge
> across to another door on the far North side.

There are four entrances and exits:
 - the door to the west leads to the [West Residency
   Entrance](#west-residency-entrance).
 - the door to the north leads to the [North Residency
   Entrance](#north-residency-entrance).
 - the stairway down to the right leads to [Lower Cavern
   East](#lower-cave-east).
 - the door immediately on the left leads to the [Administrator's
   Room](#administrators-room).

### Administrator's Room

> Orderly scrolls and books line the shelves of marble room. Sitting at
> a desk is a Hound Archon, deep in its work.

A Hound Archon, Brammer, is the administrator of the Cavern of Stars.

If he meets the characters, he will ask who they are and will check to
see if they are allowed in. If not, he try to escort them out.

### Cavern Pillar

> Around the central pillar, is a beautiful garden. Trees flourish, the
> beds are full of strange and wonderful flowers, huge ivies drape over
> the edge. A dwarf, dressed in white, tends the gardens in silence.
> A Hound Archon dressed in robes stands with them.

The dwarf is Anden Barrelback

### River From a Cavern

A wide river runs out of the cave, the water runs quickly. Walking
through the water directly will take a DC17 strength check. Hanging on
the edges will take a DC16 strength check.

This river leads into the cave, a bright light shines.

players successfully enter this way.

### West Residency Entrance

This also applies to the North Residency Entrance:

> There are six doors here, three on each the left and the right. The
> middle door on the right is open. Beside each of the doors is an
> inscription *(in celestial)*. At the end of the corridor, an
> archway opens out into another room.

### North Residency Entrance

See the description for [Cavern of Stars Interior](#cavern-of-stars-interior).

There are three doors:
 - one to the left, to the kitchen, where the characters can smell food
   being cooked

> A large dining hall with ornate tables and fine cloths.

The child, Kya, can usually be found eating here.

### Baths

> A shared bathing pool is carved into the cave rock, the water flowing
> over a marble wall on the far side into another huge cave. Despite the
> cave being the same material as the outside, it's mostly in darkness,
> some light from the bathing area reflecting back. Steaming water
> tumbles out of a hole in the east wall.
>

An elvish sorcerer, Asimina, who tried to avoid using her powers during
her lifetime. In a moment of desperation, she accidentally destroyed her
own village and herself in a surge of wild magic, trying to heal her
mother.  She spends her time trying to perfect the spells to not have a
wild magic surge. She killed her whole family.

If she is distracted, this will fail. She will have a look of terror
across her face and scream "nooo-". As a wild magic surge, she will cast
*fireball* as a 3rd-level spell centred on herself.

An human artist, Almar Torrie, who failed to complete his work for the local church
which was then destroyed in an unrelated lightning strike. He can
