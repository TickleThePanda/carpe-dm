## The Staff of Skonarith

Skonarith was a tyrant who dominated the world through his magic. When
he was defeated, his soul was trapped his ornamental staff so that his
powers could be harnessed by the usurper. When the usurper became
possessed by the staff, it was split into three parts, splitting its
abilities: [Ith](#ith-the-orb-of-empathy), the Orb of Emapthy;
[Sko](#sko-the-staff-of-domination), the Staff of Domination; and
[Nar](#nar-the-braces-of-independence), the Braces of Independence.

### Recombining the Staff

If each of the elements is willing (or is forced), the staff can be
reformed from its parts.

## Ith, the Orb of Empathy
*Wonderous Item, Rare (requires attunement by a good creature)*

A dark red pearlescent orb, its contents swirling, was split from the
Staff of Skonarith. It is kept safe in Lunia, Mount Celestia, out of
fear it may hold the evil of Skonarith. If under the right conditions,
this can be recombined with the other parts
[The Staff of Skonarith](#recombining-the-staff).

The orb has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and
expend 1 charge to cast the *detect thoughts* spell (save DC 15) from it.
The orb regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Sentience.** *Ith* is a sentient neutral good wondrous item with an
Intelligence of 12, Charisma of 12, and Wisdom of 18. It can read,
speak, and understand Celestial and Common. It can communicate
telepathically with any creature within 60ft and with any character that
is attuned to it. It has hearing and vision out for 30ft.

**Personality.** When feeling a particularly strong emotion, *Ith* will
sometimes lose control of itself and telepathically broadcast this to
other creatures nearby.

*Ith* is the empathy of Skonarith, what little empathy there there was,
but in separation from the rest, it has grown in power.*Ith* wants to
protect others from harm, especially oppression, though, it believes its
own powers should only be used against those who dominate.

The orb misses *Nar*, the Braces of Independence, and wishes to be
reunited with the bracers.

The orb is ashamed of its weakness and the hurt that caused to others
and that it may end up being by *Sko* again. If it is asked to use the
powers against those who do not deserve it, a conflict will arise
between it and its wielder.


## Sko, the Staff of Domination
*Wonderous Item, Legendary (requires attuenement)*

It has the power to control others.

## Nar, the Braces of Independence
*Wonderous Item, Legendary (requires attunement)*

It has the power to shield itself from domination.
