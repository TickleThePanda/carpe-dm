title: "The Lonely Tower"
type: "Chapter"
---

The tower stands tall, around 130ft, it narrows slightly towards the
top. There's no decoration and no windows. The unweathered stone is
smooth to touch.

A prison for Elydir, she is bound here until the Dawnsword Amulet is
returned to her.

The door faces towards the entrance of the valley and is easy to find.

### The door

> Although the rest of the tower lacks decoration, carved into the stone
> is the shape of a huge door. Above the door, you can see runes making
> up 5 words that you do not recognise and cannot read.

Anybody who tries to work out which language it is and makes a
successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check discovers that the
language is Carnian, a lost language. If the language can be understood,
it reads: ‘Safe we keep her. Allow no will.’ The original intent,
however, was: ‘This keeps us safe from her, do not free her.’

To enter, the characters must speak the word _unbind_ or _free_.

### Entering the tower

> The stones making up the doorway turn to a bright light. The light
> fades, revealing a short passage into the tower. The passage leads to
> a brightly lit landing; glass half–bowls filled with flame on the
> walls. From here, stairs spiral upwards, starting on your right.
> Apart from this, the landing is empty.

The passage stays open after everybody walks in.

The stairway follows up and around, eventually reaching a landing with a
door on the left — facing the centre of the tower.

The lamps are made with _Continual Flame_.

### Reaching the study

> After you open the door, you see a large circular room before you. The
> same torches as before light it. Luxurious furniture is sparsely
> spread around the room, although its style is unlike anything you've
> seen before.
>
> On the left wall, there's a four–poster bed with a chest sitting at
> the end, and large wardrobe to the side of the bed. On the opposite
> side, a huge bookcase is crammed with scrolls and books. In the centre
> of the room is a large table that's dressed with food. Closest to you
> is a desk facing the door. The smell of incense fills the room.
>
> Sitting at the desk is a woman: her hair grey and face wrinkled,
> pointed ears poke out under a circlet with a ruby gemstone set, and
> her robes are a deep dark red with intricate symbols laced in a golden
> thread.
>
> Noticing you arriving, she smiles towards you and stands, gesturing
> you into the room towards the table.
>
> ‘Ah! I'm glad that you decided to join me. Please, come in.’

Here, the woman introduces herself as Elydir. She offers the characters
food and drink, and if they accept, food will appear at the table.

She will explain that her quest is to have her stolen amulet retrieved.
She's chosen them because it was taken from her a long time ago and it's
likely to be a perilous journey to retrieve it. The amulet is in the
_Tomb of the Last Rehani_, which is close to _the City of Renaura_ which
is a 2 day journey from here, across the moors. She doesn't know where
the tomb is.

She will give the adventurers an very old map and some food supplies for
3 days travel.

![ A map of tower and the city in the surrounding area.](/images/unbound/area-map.jpg)

The map shows the tower and the moors with the surrounding area. The
tower is in the west and the city in the east. The moors surround the
tower for west half of the map. The city is against the mountains in the
east. A road comes from the south–east to the centre of the map,
following on east to the city. To the south of the road is a small
amount of forest before mountains, that continue east of the city. To
the north west of the moors and to north of the road is a forest.
