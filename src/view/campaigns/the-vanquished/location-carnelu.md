Village of about 800 people.

The village has two taverns:

- _The Toad's Inn_ - The inn is a single storey half-timbered building,
  with dwarf-wrought iron tables and chairs. It is well lit by an iron
  chandelier. Accomodations consist of several hammocks in the common
  room. Very popular with the locals, has very poor accommodation and
  food but cheap and plentiful beer. The innkeeper is a willowy female
  human named Suse.
- _The Grey Huntress_ - The inn is a grand half-timbered building, with
  carved wooden doors. Accomodations consist of several large rooms
  with beds and woolen mattresses. The inn is locally known for the
  variety of its meads and wines. The innkeeper is an old male human
  named Altes.

There's a small market which has general, easy to buy wares but there
is no general trading store. There is a travelling merchant who will
sell finer wares.
