This adventure was planned as a single–session adventure (9-11 hours)
for three sixth-level characters:

- Meriele, a half–elf rogue
- Elmon, an elf bard
- Prince Aseir, a human fighter

## What's happened so far

It's been a week since the characters freed the city from Qa'lir's
control. They've been paid 250gp each to help with the securing of the
city.

## Renauria region

## Introduction (Pertana's mansion)

> It's been a week since you have freed the City of Renaura from
> Qa'lir's control. Since then, you've been paid a 250gp each to help
> secure the city from the creatures remaining here and the castle.
> You've made good progress and are to meet with Lady
> Pertana, who is still ruling the city in the place of King
> Morcant. During this time you've seen a lot of things:
> constructs made by Qa'lir fight anything around them; stationed wights
> murder innocents; and lots of fleeing cultists
>
> Right now, you're in Lady Pertana's study discussing the progress
> in protecting the city. Pertana is sitting at her desk. There are
> papers piled and an empty glass of wine. Her eyes are bloodshot and
>
> "We've been able to bring in some more of our guards from the
> surrounding areas," Pertana says. "We've seen an abatement in the
> reports of bandit and goblin attack which is a great relief.
>
> "I'm very grateful for the work that you've been putting in over the
> past week. Without your help, I'm doubtful that the city will have
> survived.
>
> "Since the attack, we've been able to gather from our prisoners that
> Qa'lir was planning something call-"
>
> A piercing screech interrupts Pertana, "for what you have done -
> Meriele, Elmon, and Aseir - you will know _only_ pain."
>
> You each hear a whisper of a discordant melody and are wracked with a
> terrible pain. The room spins and your vision blurs.

At this point, ask the characters to make a Wisdom Saving Throw (DC 19).
On a failed save, the characters take 5d6 psychic damage. On a
successful save, the characters take half.

> The melody subsides. After reorientating yourselves, you realise that
> the sound seemed to come from Meriele.
>
> Pertana is standing and looking shocked and concerned but looks
> unharmed. She is pointing at Meriele and says "What _was_ that! It
> came from you!"

## Renaura

Renaura is recovering slowly from its recent ordeal, but the people and
guards are exhausted.

### The Castle Library

Info about Elydir's history and nearby elven village, Aymeluma, from the
symbol that they show the. The symbol that he knows of doesn't include
the chain.

Things that the castle librarian knows:

- Aymeluma is lead by the Glynlamin family.
- The location of the village, on the other side of the mountains. The
  options to get there: the mountain pass that gets there, which should
  take less than a day; or the roads around the mountains that would
  take a week instead.
- There's an ancient connection between the city and the elven village.
  The eldest son of King Rehani was meant to marry an elf from there
  but that was before the Morcant family took over rule from the Rehani.

### Ironwood Street hideout

Ironwood Street is a small back-ally of a much larger road in the city.

A symbol shown to the players by Xolbi can be found here, and it marks
the location of the hideout. This can be found using a DC 16 perception
check, or by using thieves cant.

> The entrance to the hideout is a small door which is locked that
> requires a DC 18 check to unlock it, or a DC 15 Strength check.
>
> This opens out into a small, 15ft by 20ft room. The room has a table,
> and a chair and the floor is covered in straw. At the other end of the
> room is a staircase that leads down, torches on the walls.
>
> A cloaked man stands in the room with a knife out, liquid glistens on
> the blade.

This man is an assassin who will defend the stairwell.

> This door leads into a brightly lit room. The room is rectangular and
> is 20 ft on the side you just entered on, and 30ft long. Along the
> walls are sconces filled with flame.
>
> There are two podiums in the room, one 5ft away from you, the other
> 5ft away from the other wall. The closest podium has a glass orb on
> it.
>
> At the other end of the room, there is a stone doorway but no handle
> or keyhole.

There's a door at the other end of the room which will be opened if the
orb is moved from one podium to the other.

When the orb is removed, the characters must succeed on a DC 22
Dexterity saving throw or else be thrown to a random place in the room.
The person holding the orb must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving
throw or else drop and smash the orb.

In the room behind the door, there's 200gp, an antique carved wood
plate, inlaid with bone (40gp), a sturdy alabaster figurine of a tower,
set with a chalcedony (80gp), and a durable adamantine bowl, inlaid with
platinum (500gp). On top of the pile is a simple golden crown, which is
the Rehani crown.

## The Renau Mountain path

Steep mountain path that winds up the wooded foothills of the mountains.
As the path climbs the mountain, it will climb along the top of an icy
ravine, with cliffs down to the right. This path climbs for about 10
miles. Along the top of this ravine, it's _extremely cold_ (p110 DMG).

About 7 miles up the mountain, there will be _strong winds_ (p110 DMG)
and is obscured by heavy snow (p110 DMG, heavy precipitation). Players
will think they hear a howling on the wind. Around here, a DC 16
perception check will show that there are animal tracks around. A
successful DC 18 Wisdom (Survival) check will identify these as three
wolves and two winter wolves which have travelled up the mountain.

After another mile, the players will be set upon by two _winter wolves_
(p340 MM) and _three wolves_ (p341 MM). In the area there will be chunks
of _slippery ice_ (p110 DMG), tall cliffs and rocks to hide behind.

After another half mile, the ravine eventually disappears and the
characters are now in a path between two mountains, still climbing.

At the top of path following up the ravine, the path splits: to the
north, further up the mountain; and to the east, down the mountain. A
mostly covered signpost shows that the [[mountain monastry]] is up the
mountain, and Aymeluma is down the mountain.

Coming back down the mountain on east side, the players will follow a
river that joins from the east of the mountain.

### Random encounters

Use the [random mountain encounters](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_vatXlRE-gvVGJfV2FLaHBpNTg/view)
for every quarter day of travel (apart from the first day). Use 1d6 to
determine whether the characters find a location, landmark, or feature.

During night, use the [long rest events](http://dndspeak.com/2017/12/100-long-rest-events/)
table.

## Renau Cloudpeak Monastry

Cloudpeak Monastry is the lair of a silver dragon, Xolbi who is in human
form. This monastery is served by ten acolytes and a priest of Torm.

The monastery is 12 miles from the split in the path, further up the
mountain. Players need to be careful they don't get lost (_Becoming
Lost_ p111 DMG) following this path. In the distance, up the mountain,
they can hear a bell ring every hour.

After 11 miles of travel up this path (or further if they get lost), the
characters will reach a point where the wind calms and the snow stops.

From a distance:

> Ahead of you, the cold weather. Huge cliffs of clouds and falling snow
> surround a temple. The temple leans against the mountain, its walls
> made of worn stone some of which have crumbled.
>
> The temple has a steep gabled roof, a spire on the left, and a
> spire missing on the right. It has a door that door faces south. To
> the west a much smaller adjoined building connects to the west,
> nestled between the mountain and the temple.
>
> To the east, there is rubble with a large bell sticking out of the
> snow.

They won't be able to hear anything from the outside but on a DC 16
Wisdom (Perception) check, they will see movement in one of the towers.
The acolyte on watch, Jrena, has a passive perception of 11 and, if she
sees the players, she will warn Xolbi that they're coming.

As the players approach the building from a distance:

> You see that, what originally looked like broken walls there are
> clouds holding in shape. The missing spire and bell-tower are also
> fashioned in this way as well. The door will have the symbol of a
> right hand gauntlet with the palm facing forward, a closed eye facing
> outward.

When the players get close to the door, the eye will open, and a sound
will come from it. It will pose them a question:

> Welcome, travellers, to Cloudpeak Temple. To enter here, you must
> answer my question truthfully:
>
> You're in a conference with a being of incredible might. This being
> has given you an offer - peace and tranquility for all of those in the
> world. However, it's at a price. You must choose a innocent creature,
> an innocent child of a farmer who is your friend, and torture this
> child for eternity. On this child's tears, this new world would be
> built.
>
> Answer me honestly, each of you, would you take this being's offer?

No matter, the answer that the players, give, the door will let them in.
Those who answer that they won't will be given the benefits of _Bless_
spell for 24 hours.

Once they are let in:

> Light and warmth fills the very large room which fills the whole space
> within. Torches adorn the walls. You can smell spices and bread.
>
> The walls and ceiling are a mixture of stone and cloud. About eight
> people are praying quietly in this temple.

If they have been noticed, Xolbi will be waiting to welcome the
characters. Otherwise, when they enter, the priest will greet them and
an acolyte will be sent to fetch Xolbi.

### Xolbi

> A tall, slender figure stands before you, with a friendly smile and
> arms out, welcoming. They have sharp cheekbones, a thick jaw, with
> cropped hair and is wearing lavish colourful robes.

Xolbi will welcome them in, and offer rest, food, and shelter to the
characters.

Xolbi knows information about how to get to Mount Celestia. However,
they will want to get an item back that was stole from him a few years
ago.

The item is the ancient crown of Rehani that had been recovered from the
old tomb a very long time ago. This crown will boost a character's
Charisma by 2 up to a maximum of 20.

They know that it's been taken by a Drow thief who is now in Renaura,
taking advantage of the recent chaos to try to sell it recently. They
know that the item is hidden in a cache, hidden in an old magician's
vault in the warehouse district, around Ironwood Street. They show the
characters a small glyph which the thief uses.

Once the characters have returned the crown to Xolbi, Xolbi will point
the characters to travel to the top of Mount Renau during the next full
moon (the following evening) at midnight. It's there that they can find
how to get to Lunia, the first layer of Mount Celestia. Xolbi will also
help the characters by keeping the weather calm until they get there.

When the characters depart, Xolbi will say "I wish goodwill on you and
to those who you may meet on your journey."

## Mount Renau Peak

The path winds further up the mountain towards the peak.

On the way up the peak, the characters will be given the option to save
a lost monk. The lost monk is a Deva in disguise.

The wind howls at the top of the peak but the sky is clear. At night,
the moon can be seen rising up. Once it's at its peak, the wind will
calm and a summers warmth will fill the characters. A silver pool will
appear, and the monk that they met on the way up the mountain along with
it. After he appears, large white wings sprout from his back and armour
and a large swords appear. If they did not save him, he will try to
prevent the characters from reaching the pool, otherwise he will let
them past.

The silvery pool is opaque but if the players are well footed, they can
put their heads through. On the other side, the characters can see that
the portal is 20ft in the air above a silvery sea. If they look around
they can see a few small boats. To the north, they can see land.

The air feels summery the sea is calm.

The session ends when the players jump in.

## Jairnt

![image](/images/jairnt-map.svg)

Small village with a tavern called _The Watchers Tavern_, the
accommodation is modest.

The players may hear about the rumours.

## Carnelu

![image](/images/carnelu-map.svg)

Village of about 800 people.

The village has two taverns:

- _The Toad's Inn_ - The inn is a single storey half-timbered building,
  with dwarf-wrought iron tables and chairs. It is well lit by an iron
  chandelier. Accomodations consist of several hammocks in the common
  room. Very popular with the locals, has very poor accommodation and
  food but cheap and plentiful beer. The innkeeper is a willowy female
  human named Suse.
- _The Grey Huntress_ - The inn is a grand half-timbered building, with
  carved wooden doors. Accomodations consist of several large rooms
  with beds and woolen mattresses. The inn is locally known for the
  variety of its meads and wines. The innkeeper is an old male human
  named Altes.

There's a small market which has general, easy to buy wares but there
is no general trading store. There is a travelling merchant who will
sell finer wares.

## Aymeluma

Approaching the village:

> There's a stench on the wind. An oppressive, malignant smell. Blood.
> Smoke.
>
> Through the trees, you can see glimpses of ornate stone buildings.

When arriving at the village:

> The stench of destruction is overpowering here.
>
> You can see around 12 limestone buildings, a river flowing from west
> to east splitting the village in two. The small river flows serenely,
> despite the terrible scenes in front of you. A small stone bridge
> crosses the river. On the north side of the river, you can see a small
> town square, dark click red patches cover the paved square.
>
> Most of the other buildings have collapsed, their contents smouldering
> and their white husks blackened. Cracking stains of carmine are
> scattered along their walls. There are broken carved pillars and
> arches - hints of the elaborate patterns and ornate structures.
>
> On the west side of the town square, a slightly larger building is
> still mostly standing. Its walls are blackened, like most of the
> others, and you can see that the ceiling has collapsed in a few
> places.

If the characters have got to this village within a day of leaving
Renaura, if they make a successful DC20 Wisdom (Perception) check to
hear if anything is in the area, they will hear what sounds like distant
shouting to the south.

Investigation checks DC15 will show signs of dragged bodies to carts and

### The ruined residence of Shafina

If the players have made it to the village within two days of leaving
Renaura, they will find a young elven girl, Shyrrik Shafina trapped in
one of the ruined buildings. She will shout for the players if she sees
or hears them.

She will want her mother, Pharom Shafina, who she saw being dragged away
by orcs. She will remember seeing a cloaked figure with the orcs.

If they fail to make it within a day, they will find Shyrrik Shafina's
body instead.

### The Glynlamin residence

This is the larger building in the town, the walls are blackened like
most of the others and some of the ceiling has collapsed on parts but
the

The doors outside the building show the symbol of Elydir, on them.

Piled in the centre of the room is smouldering furniture and books.

#### The prophecy

On one of the walls, there's a partially damaged ornate

> <span class="invisible">When</span> she tricks <span class="invisible">the wandering</span> three to unbind,<br>
> The shadow <span class="invisible"> of her</span> lover will fight but fail.<br>
> When she <span class="invisible">brings</span> destruction to <span class="invisible">all of his</span> kind,<br> > <span class="invisible">The</span> soul of her <span class="invisible">lover her end</span> will detail.<br> > <span class="invisible">Now the</span> wandering three <span class="invisible">his</span> soul they <span class="invisible">must find</span><br>
> On divine slopes <span class="invisible">her fate his soul</span> will unveil.

Originally, this would have read the following:

> When she tricks the wandering three to unbind,<br>
> The shadow of her lover will fight but fail.<br>
> When she brings destruction to all of his kind,<br>
> The soul of her lover her end will detail.<br>
> Now the wandering three his soul they must find,<br>
> On divine slopes her fate his soul will unveil.

## Nearby enemy encampment

If the players get to the enemy encampment within 2 days of leaving
Renaura then they will find the following. Otherwise, they will find
evidence of the following.

About twenty-five elves are in cages. One of the elves looks like Elydir
but younger.

Ten large orcs are camping there.

A black ornate tent is next to the fire. The same symbol on the
messenger stone is on the tent. Two orogs guard this tent.

Inside the tent, is Qa'por. If she sees the players, she will try to
attack them and subdue them, to capture them for torture.

## The Haunt of the Lonely Dagger

This is a very large castle. Its walls guarded by goblins, orcs, and
ogres.
