## Renau Cloudpeak Monastry

Cloudpeak Monastry is the lair of a silver dragon, Xolbi who is in human
form. This monastery is served by ten acolytes and a priest of Torm.

The monastery is 12 miles from the split in the path, further up the
mountain. Players need to be careful they don't get lost (_Becoming
Lost_ p111 DMG) following this path. In the distance, up the mountain,
they can hear a bell ring every hour.

After 11 miles of travel up this path (or further if they get lost), the
characters will reach a point where the wind calms and the snow stops.

From a distance:

> Ahead of you, the cold weather. Huge cliffs of clouds and falling snow
> surround a temple. The temple leans against the mountain, its walls
> made of worn stone some of which have crumbled.
>
> The temple has a steep gabled roof, a spire on the left, and a
> spire missing on the right. It has a door that door faces south. To
> the west a much smaller adjoined building connects to the west,
> nestled between the mountain and the temple.
>
> To the east, there is rubble with a large bell sticking out of the
> snow.

They won't be able to hear anything from the outside but on a DC 16
Wisdom (Perception) check, they will see movement in one of the towers.
The acolyte on watch, Jrena, has a passive perception of 11 and, if she
sees the players, she will warn Xolbi that they're coming.

As the players approach the building from a distance:

> You see that, what originally looked like broken walls there are
> clouds holding in shape. The missing spire and bell-tower are also
> fashioned in this way as well. The door will have the symbol of a
> right hand gauntlet with the palm facing forward, a closed eye facing
> outward.

When the players get close to the door, the eye will open, and a sound
will come from it. It will pose them a question:

> Welcome, travellers, to Cloudpeak Temple. To enter here, you must
> answer my question truthfully:
>
> You're in a conference with a being of incredible might. This being
> has given you an offer - peace and tranquility for all of those in the
> world. However, it's at a price. You must choose a innocent creature,
> an innocent child of a farmer who is your friend, and torture this
> child for eternity. On this child's tears, this new world would be
> built.
>
> Answer me honestly, each of you, would you take this being's offer?

No matter, the answer that the players, give, the door will let them in.
Those who answer that they won't will be given the benefits of _Bless_
spell for 24 hours.

Once they are let in:

> Light and warmth fills the very large room which fills the whole space
> within. Torches adorn the walls. You can smell spices and bread.
>
> The walls and ceiling are a mixture of stone and cloud. About eight
> people are praying quietly in this temple.

If they have been noticed, Xolbi will be waiting to welcome the
characters. Otherwise, when they enter, the priest will greet them and
an acolyte will be sent to fetch Xolbi.

### Xolbi

> A tall, slender figure stands before you, with a friendly smile and
> arms out, welcoming. They have sharp cheekbones, a thick jaw, with
> cropped hair and is wearing lavish colourful robes.

Xolbi will welcome them in, and offer rest, food, and shelter to the
characters.

Xolbi knows information about how to get to Mount Celestia. However,
they will want to get an item back that was stole from him a few years
ago.

The item is the ancient crown of Rehani that had been recovered from the
old tomb a very long time ago. This crown will boost a character's
Charisma by 2 up to a maximum of 20.

They know that it's been taken by a Drow thief who is now in Renaura,
taking advantage of the recent chaos to try to sell it recently. They
know that the item is hidden in a cache, hidden in an old magician's
vault in the warehouse district, around Ironwood Street. They show the
characters a small glyph which the thief uses.

Once the characters have returned the crown to Xolbi, Xolbi will point
the characters to travel to the top of Mount Renau during the next full
moon (the following evening) at midnight. It's there that they can find
how to get to Lunia, the first layer of Mount Celestia. Xolbi will also
help the characters by keeping the weather calm until they get there.

When the characters depart, Xolbi will say "I wish goodwill on you and
to those who you may meet on your journey."
