## Background introduction

This campaign takes place in the region of Ternia in the areas
surrounding the City of Renaura. Ternia exists somewhere the forgotten
realms.

### Elidyr and the Olinarelidyr

Since her escape using her amulet, Elidyr's has been planning to release
great evil on the world as revenge for her prolonged imprisonment. The
characters will remember the symbol on her amulet as a rising sun behind
a dagger pointing down <small>(this was not revealed to the players in
[Unbound](/adventures/unbound/plan/) but the characters will recognise
it)</small>.

Elidyr works in total secrecy, concealing her location with magic. She
commands two loyal spellcasters _Qa'lir_ and _Qa'por_, known to her as
the _Olinarelidyr_. Qa'lir and Qa'por are twins. They are know to common
folk as "The Vanquished Fist". The Olinarelidyr have been tasked with
bringing Ternia under her control. Elidyr communicates with the
Olinarelidyr using sending stones, each carved with Elidyr's
symbol and their own.

### Qa'lir and Qa'por

The first of the Olinarelidyr, Qa'lir, travelled to Renaura to overthrow
King Morcant and place a puppet in his place.

Qa'lir's symbol is a rope burning in the middle. The symbol on the
shared sending stone with Elidyr is shown by a rope burning in the
middle under Elidyr's symbol.

The second, Qa'por, is travelling to bring armies of evil creatures to
Elidyr's side. It's unlikely that the characters will find Qa'por,
though they will find information that will help them find Qa'por in the
future.

Qa'por's symbol is a shattered chain. The symbol on the shared sending
stone with Elidyr is shown by a shattered chain under Elidyr's symbol.

Qa'lir and Qa'por share a sending stone, the symbol shows a shattered
chain and a burning rope in a circle, tied together.

### The City of Renaura

The prosperity of Renaura has now passed. The influence of Qa'lir has
spread corruption in almost all parts of the city.

### The Deposition of King Morcant

Qa'lir arrived in Renaura and quickly garnered respect as a rich
merchant with the nobles. She quickly became close to Telnetar,
eventually casting a spell to force Telnetar to do her bidding and
threatening Telnetar's family.

Qa'lir spent the next few weeks building a new guard force for Telnetar.
Buying some of them, threatening some of them, and replacing some by
apprentice spell casters. She personally replaced the old guard captain

King Morcant had regular meetings with Telnetar, and Qa'lir used this to
stage the coup. Telnetar, attending this meeting bringing his guards
along, citing a recent attempt against his life, and was allowed to keep
the guards with him.

When the Telnetar and the guards arrived for the meeting in the castle's
parlour, they immediately fought King Morcant's guards, attempting to
kill the Lord. Qa'lir and the replaced guards used dark magic during the
fight. Telnetar, realising a flaw in the magic that was binding him to
Qa'lir's magic, told King Morcant to flee during the fight. King
Morcant, realising the threat, fled with his family.

### The Kidnapping of Telnetar's Family

After Telnetar's disobedience to Qa'lir, Qa'lir ordered Telnetar's
family to be kidnapped to ensure Telnetar's good behaviour.

### Qa'lir in Renaura

Qa'lir's servants are _wights_.

Qa'lir has spies throughout all parts of the city, from beggars to
servants in the remaining noble's houses. It only takes hours for
displays of rebellion to reach the ears of Qa'lir. These spies have been
bribed or threatened by Qa'lir's servants.

### Guards

One of Qa'lir's first director orders through Telnetar as a puppet was
to replace the head of the guard with one of her _wight_ servants,
Kexor. One of Kexor's first orders was to kidnap Telnetar's family.

In general, the guards now live in fear of Lord Telnetar and Kexor where
before they were happy to serve. Severe disobedience usually leads to
corporal or capital punishment. The guards are rarely used by the city
government to prevent crime but instead are used to prevent the uprising
of the people.

Guards are rarely punished for villainy and some (roughly 3/10) are
revelling in it.

A rare few very good natured guards (roughly 1/10) will be willing to
help the characters, especially if they see something that makes them
realise the corruption. These guards will usually do it privately
fearing the other guards. Most will be caught at some point.

The remaining guards will follow most commands from their superiors out
of fear.

### Civilians

Crime is now rife in the city, though very little of it is organised.
Qa'lir has killed or threatened most of the gangs within the city.

Between harassment from guards and the rising crime in the city, most of
the civilians are downtrodden. A lot of civilians believe that Telnetar
was just waiting to seize the opportunity to take the city.

### The noble houses of Renaura

There are three noble houses of Renaura. Each have held their family
positions for a long time and have prospered under the rule of the
Morcants.

#### The noble house of Telnetar

The family of Telnetar were some of the earlier supporters of the
Morcant's and have maintained a very close relationship with the crown.
They were a rich merchant family, focussing on rich foods and drinks.

The leader of the Telnetar, Meneri Telnetar is currently controlled by
Qa'lir.

#### The noble house of Farnit

The family of Farnit own multiple mines, ranging from economic metals to
precious metals and stones.

#### The noble house of Pertana

The family of Perthana own a large amount of the land.

## The recurring dream

> Meriele and Prince Aseir, you have been having recurring dreams
> recently; not every night, but every few nights. The dreams always
> start with you woken up suddenly by an ageing elven woman. With her
> help, you flee a different horror or are drawn by the promise of
> reward to a distant tower.
>
> Tall and alone, the unadorned tower stands in an almost barren valley.
> Its stonework is slotted together; each stone taller than a human but
> placed no further apart than a fingernail.
>
> You're brought to the base of the tower, where there's the outline of
> a doorway carved in the stone of the building, facing the bottom of
> the valley. It's here she says to ‘Wait here until there are three
> and then speak the password “Unbind”.’
>
> The dreams end there. Some of the specifics fade, but you can still
> remember the way to the tower and women who helps you.
>
> Elmon, you received a letter from a friend, somebody who you trust,
> that invites you to travel to this location — you have the letter with
> you.
>
> Attracted by these, you've travelled to this location.
>
> You have all, making your own journeys, finally arrived. The cold,
> drizzle, and blustery wind fight through your clothes, chilling you.
> You can smell the musk of the heather and peat. You arrived at
> different times over the last few days, Meriele, then Prince Aseir,
> then Elmon.
