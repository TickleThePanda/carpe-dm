Renaura is a prosperous ancient city which has survived thousands of
years of change.

## Nobles

### Morcant

The Princes of Renauria

### Telnetar

The family of Telnetar were some of the earlier supporters of the
Morcant's and have maintained a very close relationship with the crown.
They were a rich merchant family, focussing on rich foods and drinks.

The leader of the Telnetar, Meneri Telnetar is currently controlled by
Qa'lir.

### Farnit

The family of Farnit own multiple mines, ranging from economic metals to
precious metals and stones.

### Pertana

The family of Perthana own a large amount of the land.

## Approaching Renaura

> You're following the road south towards the city, through the forest
> in the foothills of the mountain. The ground is icy and a thin layer
> of snow covers the road. Most of the trees are bare.

> The forest clears after a few miles, showing the bare foothills
> surrounding the City of Renaura which is a few miles away. Though most
> of the city is hidden from you by the surrounding valley, you can see
> the familiar sight of the scarred city walls and a few of the taller
> buildings that are in the lower parts of the city. The city gate is
> open but only a few people are passing in and out of it. Smoke rises
> from some of the chimneys of the homesteads but their farms are quiet.
> A few look to be entirely abandoned.

> Nestled in a steep valley is a small city: the valley's impassable
> natural walls overshadowing the stone-crafted ones. There's a castle
> burrowed into the top reaches where the surrounding mountains draw
> closest. A single gatehouse guards the walls that span the bottom of
> the steep valley.

### City gates

> As you approach the city, you can see that the walls scarred and worn,
> some newer stonework replaces sections.
>
> A steady flow of people are passing in and out of the gates. A couple
> of bored looking guards standing on either side, almost ignoring the
> small rabble.

Anyone who wants to know the history of the city and makes a successful
DC 15 Intelligence (History) check knows that it's an

The guards give the characters no trouble entering the city.

### Entering the gates

> You've passed through the city gates. A busy main street climbs up.
> Behind the stone houses that are set against the mountainside, you can
> see the tops of the castle's towers.
>
> The street, leading to the city's square, is lined with an assortment
> of busy market stalls. Farmers and merchants are bartering. A
> procession of robed figures part the crowd, walking away from you
> towards the centre of the city. Guards wander, chatting with
> merchants, watching the stalls.

Here the characters have a whole range of options for finding out where
the tomb is:

- merchants will point the characters towards March, the bar–keep at
  _The Dragon's Claw_ which is ‘just up the road — the bar–keep there
  talks about mad things like this’, if they're convinced by the
  characters
- guards will point the characters towards the scholar, Ret, who works
  in the castle library, if they're convinced by the characters
- priests will welcome the characters to join their procession to the
  Temple of Ilmater where the scholarly acolytes might know of such a
  place
- general populace will be relatively helpful, pointing the characters
  straight to March _The Dragon's Claw_

### Temple of Ilmater

> In the centre of the city's square, there's a large round building.
> Outside, there's a statue of a bound man on his knees weeping. The
> figure is scarred and his limbs are at unsettling angles. On it, in
> common, is inscribed:
>
> > We welcome all to the house of Ilmater.

At the temple, the characters will be encouraged by a greeter, who will
introduce themselves as Wurcon, to pray.

The temple has a scholar that knows of the local tombs. Wurcon will take
the characters to the her in the "records" room further in the temple.

> Wurcon pushes a small door open that takes you into a small room small
> room, only a few feet wide, lit by candles. The room has a few
> bookcases in it, with scrolls and tomes on their shelves.
>
> Despite you entering the room rather loudly, a young woman who is
> hunched at the desk, has not looked up from the scroll she was
> reading. Next to her is a discarded plate of bread and cheese.
>
> "Glanna. Glanna? Glanna! Hey! We have some travellers looking for some
> information about a nearby Tomb and I was hoping you could help them."
>
> It seems to take her a little to return to the world from the text,
> and she still glances back to it.

The scholar will help the characters but won't do it gladly. She will be
sharp with them and not really going too much out of her way to give
them information.

The scholar, sighing, will find a map and will point the characters to
the correct place on a map. She knows a little of the history of the
tombs.

> This is to the Tomb of the Last Rehani where the old Kings are buried
> — this is from before our current rulers, the Morcant family came here.
> Unfortunately — we those who worship Ilmater (the God of Endurance) —
> we're not that good at keeping detailed records of history.
>
> From my study of our small collection of histories, I can tell you
> that their rule was tumultuous. There were different powers at play
> within the city leaders. I think that lead to their declining power
> and, ultimately, to the marriage of their daughter with the Morcant
> family.
>
> I'm sorry I can't be any more helpful with the details here.
>
> You're welcome to read through the books on history that we have here
> but I don't think you'll find much more than I've given you. If you do
> choose to do so, I'd prefer for you to go elsewhere so as not to cause
> any more distraction to me.

### The Dragon's Claw

> Fighting away the cold, a roaring fire crackles. The funk of pipe weed
> smoke and stale beer linger. There are a few people sitting around the
> inn: a small group of younger men are playing dice, a hooded figure
> watching the door from an alcove, a woman hunched at the bar.
>
> Behind the bar a balding man with silver hair is cleaning tankards.

At the inn, the bar–keep, March, will very gladly welcome the characters
to sit at the almost–empty bar and to have a drink. He will gladly tell
mildly accurate stories about a nearby tomb.

> I don't know of the Tomb of the Last Rehani but there is an old tomb
> outside the city. The old Lords of this city are buried there.
>
> Ooooohhh, there's lots of rumours about this place. Some people say
> it's haunted by a ghost sworn to protect it. Others say that the dead
> themselves walk the halls. I know that a scholar from the castle
> library went there recently never to return.
>
> I doubt it's _the dead_ that got her, though. Much more likely that
> it's the goblins that use the place as a hide–out. I know that's not a
> rumour! They don't really cause a problem to the people in the city so
> the Lord here hasn't done anything about them.

He continues to ramble about the troubles that the goblins cause to the
farmers.

### Upper city

> As your tiring journey takes you higher up the city, closer to the
> castle, the buildings become closer together, making the city narrower.
> Closest to the castle, the path follows the side of one of the valley
> walls with large mansions on the other side.

### The Castle

#### Castle wall

The castle's wall is guarded by eight guards.

> Eventually, you pass the last building and ahead of you are the walls
> to the castle. These walls stretch across the valley from one side to
> another, though that space is now only 50 ft.
>
> Behind the walls you can see a stone castle with two towers at the
> front. Layers continue behind it, each one building on the mountain's
> incline.
>
> The path takes you to the centre of this wall to a gatehouse. There
> are 4 guards standing at this entrance, barring your way. More stand
> on the wall.

The guards will only allow the players to pass under the condition of
being accompanied by a guard if:

- The characters can show a right of passage document signed by a Lord
  or Lady.
- The guards are bribed for 8gp per character.
- The characters succeed at a DC 20 Charisma check.

#### Castle courtyard

> Through the gate is a courtyard and gardens, the
> castle about 60ft away from you. In the centre is a fountain, although
> there's no water flowing.
>
> Here, you can only see the front of the castle, a round tower built up
> against the walls of the mountain. Large carved wooden doors are
> closed at the front, a guard standing on either side.
>
> There's almost a direct path along the middle towards the wooden doors.
> A path runs to the right, following the valley's wall, to a smaller
> side entrance with little ornamentation.

#### Servants' corridor

> The stone corridor is narrow. Plain doors

#### Path to the secret entrance

This cave entrance can be seen with a telescope or similar object from
distance.

The characters will have to find a way to get up to the cave entrance
which is 150ft up the cliff or 50ft across the cliff.

If they have the appropriate gear, they will be able to do it without
any checks.

#### Cave entrance

> The cave is damp and slippery. It looks like it's been hewn from the
> rock. There is no light and the you can't see the end.

At the end of the passage, the characters can see it open out into the
bridge across the chasm.

#### Bridge across the chasm

> From earlier in the passage, you could have mistakenly think this
> opened into a room. It is, however, a huge chasm. On both your side
> and the other side there's a balcony about 50 feet across, with
> balustrades on the sides. Across the middle is a bridge that's 10 feet
> across and about 40 feet long. The bridge doesn't have any railing.
>
> To the left and right of the bridge on both balconies, statues look
> ahead with swords held out.
>
> At the far end is a door, in front of which is a small obelisk.

The statues will wake (Animated Armour) unless the characters bow to
them. If the characters bow to them after they wake, they will return to
their guarding positions.

When the players reach the obelisk:

> The obelisk has a small rounded indent at the top.

The key (the small orb) must be placed on the top of the obelisk for the
door to open. The characters will hear a click when they put it on top
of the obelisk.

Behind the door is a spiral staircase that leads upwards.

#### Up to the castle

A spiral staircase takes the characters upwards. When the reach the top
of the spiral staircase, they will reach a wall with a lever. The wall
will have small eye holes that the characters can see through which they
will see by the light coming out of them. They will be able to hear a
man weeping.

The characters will be able to see through the holes in the wall a
throne room, with torches on the wall. A man is on a throne, weeping.

Pulling the lever will cause the wall to slide open, causing a loud
scraping sound.

This wall will reveal the throne room.

#### The throne room

> The throne room is set up for dining, full of tables and chairs. There
> is nobody else in the room apart from the weeping man. At the far end
> of the room is a set of double doors.
>
> The scraping noise of the wall opening will cause the man to jump up
> in surprise. He will shout "You shouldn't be here. Leave! Run!"
>
> The moment he shouts that, you hear a loud crack and a cloaked figure
> appears, pushing the man back into his throne. She has a chiseled face
> is obsidian with dark blue streaks and she has white hair. She has a
> symbol of a sun emblazoned on her cloak with a dagger in front of it.
>
> The figure laughs and with an elvish accent says, "Shut up old man."
>
> "Now, now, this _is_ a surprise. I heard you were in the city, Elmon,
> Meriele, and Aseir. Rumours of your destruction in the city over the
> last few days have reached my ears. I wasn't expecting to find you
> right in here, though!
>
> "Let me introduce myself, I am Qa'lir OlinarElydir." She bows. "I am
> glad to be finally meeting you. You see, I am in great debt to you,
> it's through your actions that I can be here today.
>
> "Please! Sit! I'll call the servants in and they can bring us some
> food."

If the characters don't sit, she will start walking towards them the
torches in the room will flicker, she will raise her hand towards them
and shout "I will enjoy destroying you. Hahahahahaha!"

If the characters do sit:

> She claps and two wights come in through the doors at the end of the
> throne room.
>
> "It's my honour to represent Elydir in this city. She sent me here to
> take the city. The destruction that I've been able to cause."
>
> She smirks and laughs.
>
> "With you here now, I would like to make you an offer. I've seen what
> havoc you can wreak.
>
> "Join me, swear allegiance to Elydir. We can cause so much
> devastation."

If the players refuse to join her, she will cast cloudkill on where the
players are and misty step away.

#### The Castle Library

> The large room is filled with books and scrolls. Every accessible
> _inch_ of the room is taken up by shelves with the narrowest of spaces
> between them.
>
> A man dressed in robes is moving books to what somebody _might_ call a
> desk, although it could just be more storage.
>
> He happily gasps as you walk in, smiling.

Info about Elydir's history and nearby elven village, Aymeluma, from the
symbol that they show the. The symbol that he knows of doesn't include
the chain.

Things that the castle librarian knows:

- Aymeluma is lead by the Glynlamin family.
- The location of the village, on the other side of the mountains. The
  options to get there: the mountain pass that gets there, which should
  take less than a day; or the roads around the mountains that would
  take a week instead.
- There's an ancient connection between the city and the elven village.
  The eldest son of King Rehani was meant to marry an elf from there
  but that was before the Morcant family took over rule from the Rehani.

He will explain to the players about the tomb's location and how to get
there, although that they don't know much about it now — the mad King
Bleiduid Morcant a few generations ago demanded the burning of anything
about the Rehanis. He will explain that one of his apprentices went
there a few weeks ago but never returned, which he sounds very sad
about. He will ask them to see if they can find this apprentice.

### Ironwood Street hideout

Ironwood Street is a small back-ally of a much larger road in the city.

A symbol shown to the players by Xolbi can be found here, and it marks
the location of the hideout. This can be found using a DC 16 perception
check, or by using thieves cant.

> The entrance to the hideout is a small door which is locked that
> requires a DC 18 check to unlock it, or a DC 15 Strength check.
>
> This opens out into a small, 15ft by 20ft room. The room has a table,
> and a chair and the floor is covered in straw. At the other end of the
> room is a staircase that leads down, torches on the walls.
>
> A cloaked man stands in the room with a knife out, liquid glistens on
> the blade.

This man is an assassin who will defend the stairwell.

> This door leads into a brightly lit room. The room is rectangular and
> is 20 ft on the side you just entered on, and 30ft long. Along the
> walls are sconces filled with flame.
>
> There are two podiums in the room, one 5ft away from you, the other
> 5ft away from the other wall. The closest podium has a glass orb on
> it.
>
> At the other end of the room, there is a stone doorway but no handle
> or keyhole.

There's a door at the other end of the room which will be opened if the
orb is moved from one podium to the other.

When the orb is removed, the characters must succeed on a DC 22
Dexterity saving throw or else be thrown to a random place in the room.
The person holding the orb must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving
throw or else drop and smash the orb.

In the room behind the door, there's 200gp, an antique carved wood
plate, inlaid with bone (40gp), a sturdy alabaster figurine of a tower,
set with a chalcedony (80gp), and a durable adamantine bowl, inlaid with
platinum (500gp). On top of the pile is a simple golden crown, which is
the Rehani crown.

## City of Renaura

### Journey to Renaura

### Approaching the city

There are eight guards at gate, two on each side, four standing in a
line across the middle. When the characters reach the gate, the guard
closest to the middle on the right will ask the characters to halt and
as what their intentions in the city are.

If the guards think the characters are suspicious, they will let them in
the city but report them to Qa'lir.

### The main street

> Where the main street was previously busy and full of life, only a few
> stalls remain staffed. Sitting in the alleyways and streets are
> beggars.

### The beggar outside the Dragon's Claw

The beggar, as the characters pass the Dragon's Claw, will say "If you
Elmon, a little help for an old friend." It will require a DC 18
Intelligence (Investigation) roll for him to recognise it's the
librarian from the castle. In any case, in exchange for food and drink,
he will promise the characters some information if they will speak in a
private place. If the characters ignore the beggar, he will seek them if
they enter the Dragon's Claw, claiming to the barman that he's returning
an item to the characters that they dropped outside.

In the private place, he will help the will give the characters some
information about the deposition of the old King Morcant where the Lord
and his daughter escaped.

### The Dragon's Claw

The mood in the dragons claw is a lot less friendly than the last time.

The barkeep will be happy to serve them. He will try very hard to sell
them on accommodation for the night that would normally be considered
comfortable.

The characters may hear about a recent announcement that a clerk from
the Temple of Ilmater is going to be executed in the morning of the next
day.

### The Temple of Ilmater

A few guards will be in the Temple of Ilmater, arguing with a senior
priest that the characters will recognise as Wurcon.

> "She is a member of the Ilmateri, you have no right to arrest her as
> no other Lord has before," shouts Wurcon.
>
> "Do not blame us for her arrest old man," one of the guards says, "the
> order came direct from Lord Telnetar and it was his own guards that
> captured her. We are only under orders to prepare for her execution."
>
> As Wurcon steps forward angrily, "You must-." The silent guard pushes
> him to the ground and says, "Do not threaten us, there is nothing we
> can do."

Wurcon, if helped by the characters, will take the characters to a side
room to explain the recent events regarding their clerk, Glanna. He will
know that Glanna left, saying that she had some temple business at the
Telnetar mansion, though he now thinks that she was up to something.

### Farnit's mansion

If the characters go to Farnit's mansion, they will be informed by
servants that their master is not around. The servant will know where
Farnit is but is reluctant to reveal that information.

### Pertana's mansion

If the characters go to Pertana's mansion, they will find both Farnit
and Pertana "discussing business" in the study. The servants will be
reluctant to let them see the nobles.

The rooms in the mansion are well decorated and it's clear that Pertana
is rich.

Farnit and Pertana will be shocked to be interrupted, will try to hide
all of the documents that they have out, draw weapons and will berate
their servants for interrupting them. They won't attack straight away
but Pertana will begrudgingly ask the players, "What business is so
important that you must interrupt our private meeting?"

> The study is large with books and parchment on large book cases on the
> wall. Wood panelling surrounds the room and it is ornately decorated.
> A fire crackles in the large fireplace.
>
> A portly middle-aged gentleman is looking over parchment and books at
> the desk. An woman is seated, reading out a passage from a book
> intently, "... and the Vanquisher, Faurin, took his own life..."
>
> Hearing you enter the woman throws the book to the ground and quickly
> draws a short sword. The man throws his cloak over the contents of the
> table. The woman shouts, "What is the meaning of this interruption!
> Servants! You were ordered to prevent anybody from entering my study."

If Farnit and Pertana think that the players might be useful or
friendly, given their notoriety, Pertana will give them the following
information:

> "I only impart this knowledge because we, the Watchers, are desperate.
> We are not generals or warriors, just traders and scholars from a
> prosperous city. We have not fought in hundreds of years and we
> wouldn't even know where to start. Many are calling Farnit and I
> apathetic towards the circumstances we face.
>
> "We are not, however, apathetic. We are fighting in our own way.
> Mostly we gather information hoping to find some way of ending the
> tyranny of Telnetar. While we have not found anything that Farnit and
> I can do, I now think there is something the three of you can do.
>
> "The day after Telnetar attacked the castle, a guarded carriage went
> from the castle to his mansion in the dead of night. The guards went
> into his mansion and fighting could be heard there. We saw the guards
> dragging some people out, into the carriages. The carriage didn't go
> back to the castle but instead to one of Telnetar's warehouses.
>
> "The day before last, Glanna (who I think you have met before)
> insisted that the best thing to do was to find out what happened in
> the mansion, as clearly something notable happened that night.
> However, she's not returned and we have heard news that she will be
> executed.
>
> "I fear that we, Farnit and I, have been revealed and that we will
> soon be.
>
> "I implore you to help us find out what happened here. I think it
> might be key to saving this city. Do whatever you think is best here,
> whether that is investigating the mansion, saving Glanna, or investing
> the warehouse."

#### Roleplaying Pertana

### Telnetar's mansion

There's a small guard presence outside the front gates of the mansion,
preventing easy access, these guards are under order from the new Lord
to prevent civilians from entering the Lord's mansion, though they don't
know what's inside. The guards will react to loud noises inside the
manor, worrying that they've failed at their job.

Iron fences, 10ft high, with hedges behind them surround the Lord
Telnetar's mansion grounds. The fences are in good condition but the
hedges are.

A few servants lucky to survive have barricaded themselves in the
noble's chambers. This chamber contains the key required to open the
secret entrance to the castle.

#### The grand entrance hall

> What was once clearly a great entrance hall is ruined. Dust, debris
> and dried blood cover most of the surfaces.
>
> A grand staircase is straight ahead, though the top half of it has
> collapsed entirely, revealing a stony dark corridor behind a
> disintegrating wall. Large chunks of the marble banister have fallen
> into the staircase. A large archway opens from the top of the stairs
> to the fist floor but the floor has collapsed where the staircase
> would have ended. Through an arch at the end of the stairs allows you
> to see into a large light room.
>
> A mangled, rotting body is slumped against the far left wall, a
> sword abandoned in its chest. Its stench filling the room.
>
> To both the left and the right of the main door are ornate arches.
> Through the left you can see shattered lounge furniture and through
> the right a gallery, though the artwork lies scattered and torn on the
> floor.
>
> On either side of these arches are collapsed suits of armour, apart
> from to the left off the left door.
>
> From the dark corridor you hear the echoing a woman cry out in pain
> and a deep raspy laugh.

If the characters approach either of the doors, the armour guarding that
door will become animated. These are _Animated Armour_ (see page 19 of
the Monster Manual).

If the characters approach the rotting body, the sword in the body will
become animated. This is a _Flying Sword_ (see page 20 of the Monster
Manual).

If the characters attempt to climb over the rubble, they will need to
make a DC 13 Dexterity check or otherwise fall down the rubble and down
the stairs.

#### The drawing room

The drawing room has shattered furniture all around. Signs of fighting
are here as well. The door to the dining room is ajar and the characters
can smell rotting food from there.

There is a secret door, leading to the servants' passage, disguised as a
wall on the right wall of the room.

#### The dining room

The stench of rotting food fills this room, the long dining table is on
its side, food all over the floor.

There are two secret doors, both leading to the servants' passage,
disguised as the wall, one on the right side of the room, one on the far
side of the room. The secret door at the far side of the room is ajar.

#### The gallery

> The paintings are torn, frames shattered; the statues broken. At the
> end of the room, there's a barred door which has a couple of broken
> statues barring it shut. Behind the doors you can hear some scratching
> and shuffling.

The barred doors lead to the library.

There is a secret door, leading to the servants' passage, disguised as a
wall on the left side of this room.

#### The library

> This room, like the others lies in ruin. It was once a library, the
> book cases are shattered and the books are on the floor.

There are eight zombies in here, they are all wearing servant's
clothing.

There are two secret doors, both leading the servants' passage,
disguised as the wall, one on the left side of the room, one on the far
side of the room.

#### The servants' passage

> A narrow stone passage.

Where the collapsed wall and stairs are from the mansion's entrance
hall, there are stairs leading downwards; however, the top step is if
you come at the stairs from the other direction.

The passage at the end has a spiral staircase up and three ordinary
doors leading to the servants' quarters. At the top of the spiral
staircase, there is immediately a wooden door. From behind it, shuffling
noises can be heard.

There are plain doors that match up to the secret doors in the drawing
room, the dining room, the gallery, and the library.

#### The servants' quarters

> The beds in this room are scattered, all of the bedding has shredded.
> There's no sign of any movement at all.

#### The kitchen

> The stench of rotting food also fills this room. The preparation
> tables are full of half-prepared food. A large cauldron has been
> knocked over at the far end of the room under a chimney. Ashes cover
> the floor. Pots and pans are scattered everywhere.
>
> There's no sign of any movement in this room.

#### The storeroom

> A room full of barrels but most of the barrels are empty apart from
> some stale bread and a few mouldy apples.

#### The grand corridor

> A long corridor, wider and ornately decorated. At the far end is a
> large window. To the left are three doors, the middle and larger one
> is closed. The others are open. To the right is a large open archway.
>
> In the corridor, four zombies wearing servant's clothing.

From the spiral staircase, the doors on the left hand side (closest to
furthers) lead to the study, master's bedroom, and dressing room.

The door to the master's bedroom won't open if the players try to push
it open. When the players do this, a man's voice from inside will shout
"Wake up! They're trying to get in again!"

The door will take a DC 14 Strength check to open it.

#### The ballroom

> A large ballroom with a large wooden ceiling. On each of the walls are
> two large windows. The broken staircase is at the other end of the
> room.
>
> In the room are another ten zombies wearing servant's clothing.

#### The study

The study is another room full of destruction. The desk is smashed and
there is paper everywhere.

#### The dressing room

The dressing room is another room full of destruction. There is rich
clothes of both lords and ladies scattered around the floor.

#### The master bedroom

> This room, slightly larger than the rooms downstairs, also has ruined
> furniture. A broken four poster bed and chest of drawers are piled
> directly in front of you, moved out of the way to let you through the
> door.
>
> A pile of food is against the left wall, in far left corner is a pile
> of bedding.
>
> To the right of the room there's a large closed chest.
>
> There are four servants and a boy looking tired and bedraggled, their
> clothing torn and soiled: two of the servants are closer to you,
> having moved the furniture; one is sitting on the bedding with the
> boy, the other is standing in guard of the chest.

The four servants in here managed to hide during the fight and then hid
in this room. They hid under the food in the barrels, one of them hid
the chest with them when they saw what was happening.

In the chest is:

- a carved ivory statuette
- a silver and gold broach
- a ceremonial electrum dagger with a black pearl in the pomel
- a lute (Doss Lute)
- a dagger (a Dagger of Venom)
- a small carved wooden box with an inscription on it

On the small carved wooden box, the inscription says:

<blockquote class="letter">

In your oath to me, you have bent your knee. Remember this oath, when
using this key.

</blockquote>

Inside the box is a small orb wrapped in fabric which has an inked map
which shows the castle and its walls and marks a small passage in the
cliff outside the castle walls to the south.

#### The cellar

> The cellar is dim, lit only by a couple of torches.
>
> At the end of the room are are iron barred prison door, both are open.
> To the left of the room is a table.
>
> In the centre of the right of the room is a bound woman and gagged
> woman, she's sobbing. Standing above her is a man ready to strike her.
> His skin is very pale ashy taut skin, he wears dark scaly armour.
