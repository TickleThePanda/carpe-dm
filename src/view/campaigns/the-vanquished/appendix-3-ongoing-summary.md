## The adventure so far

The trio met up at a wilderness tower, brought by visions in their
dreams and, for Elmond, by letter. After unlocking the tower, they spoke
to Elydir inside, who tasked them with finding a stolen family amulet
buried in the Tomb of the Last Rehani. They travelled to the City of
Renaura, found out more information about the tomb from the tavern, the
temple, and the library, and then travelled to find the tomb. In the
tomb, they fought goblins, skeletons, and the ghost of a man, Faurin, to
get to the amulet. They returned the amulet to Elydir and she
disappeared, leaving the gold promised to them behind.

---

Months later, the trio met a hooded woman who asked them to take the
throne back for King Morcant from a tyrannical supplanter, Lord
Telnetar; they agree and travel to Renaura. Here, they: rescued Glanna
and Telnetar's servants from Telnetar's mansion; met Pertana, leading a
small rebellion; and saved a family from a warehouse. Throughout all of
this, they fought sinister creatures and heard of the unusual and
uncharacteristic circumstances under which Telnetar overthrew King
Morcant. They sneaked to the castle to find Telnetar crying at the
throne - controlled by a drow mage, Qa'lir. The symbol of Elydir was
emblazoned on her robes, though with a broken chain below and a broken
rope above. They defeated Qa'lir and took a sending stone from her body,
with the same symbol.

---

While helping clean up the city, the trio received a screeching message
from Qa'lir's sending stone, threatening them for what they had done.
From the castle librarian, they found that the glyph is similar to an
elvish family's crest who live in the village of Aymeluma across the
mountain path. The trio travelled off to travel there, finding the
village mostly destroyed. In the village, they discovered the remains of
a ruined prophecy inside a building with Elydir's symbol engraved on it.
Nearby, they discovered an orc camp where elves were trapped in cages
who they helped escape. Speaking to an elf who resembled Elydir they
found out that: the elves' kidnapper was Qa'por; Elydir was understood
to be killed years ago after a grave betrayal; and the full prophecy
text. While the elves travelled to Renaura in search of safety, the
trio, hearing an explosion from the camp, returned to the camp in hopes
of killing Qa'por but failed to reach her before she disappeared
suddenly.

The trio, following the prophecy, travelled to the Cloudpeak Monastery
seeking out _divine slopes_ to find the _soul of Elydir's lover_, who
they guess is Faurin. Here, they met Xolbi, a silver dragon who wanted
them to find a stolen crown in return for helping them understand the
meaning of divine slopes in the prophecy. After helping him get the
crown, Xolbi then explained that a portal will open that night, at the
top of Mount Renau which can lead them to Mount Celestia. They set off
to immediately and pass the moral test to be allowed past. The portal, a
silvery pool, opens and the trio jump into the pool.

---

Elmond, Meriele, and Aseir fell into the silvery sea in Lunia, at the
bottom of the slopes of Mount Celestia. A leisure ship, the Lunar
Allure, rescued the players and promised to take them to a nearby city,
Heart's Faith. Before they could make it to the city, they were
intercepted by a patrol ship which escorted them to the Hall of
Salutation where the trio were questioned about why they were in Lunia.
After showing that they were not a threat, the trio were free to travel
around.

They find out that Faurin is located at the Cavern of Stars and, after
resting overnight and buying horses, they travelled there over the next
few days. Outside the cavern they recognise an elf (though in a
different form) from the Lunar Allure who the find out to called
Morcanloth. He banished Meriele, and in return, asked them to find out
the location of the Orb of Empathy from Faurin.

The trio then travelled into the cavern via a secret entrance, told to
them by Morcanloth. In the cavern, they evade capture by the guards
inside, and speak to Faurin who gives them information about: his own
and Elydir's history; the Staff of Skonarith and its parts, Sko, Nar,
and Ith; Sko likely being in Elydir's hands; and the location of Ith in
the Temple of the Corrupt Orb. They teleport to the temple, and fought
their way through there, guided by a mysterious voice, eventually taking
the orb from the animated statue within.

### Characters

#### Elydir

The trio met Elydir, an elderly elf, in the wilderness tower where she
asked them to find her amulet, a family heirloom. When the returned it,
she disappeared into thin air. They find out that she was supposedly
killed over 500 years ago by Faurin. They have seen her symbol worn by
Qa'por, Qa'lir, and in the village of Aymeluma.

Faurin tells the trio that he and Elydir were once lovers while she was
married to the abusive Lord Lainot. Together, they had naive plans to
take over which Elydir took more seriously than Faurin did. Elydir
eventually killed Lord Lainot using dark magical powers and supplanted
him, ruling tyrannically. Only by luck and wish, Faurin was able to
confine her to the wilderness tower, with the amulet as a key, in hopes
of ridding her of power.

Faurin thinks that Elydir, now she has returned, is likely to have the
Staff of Domination, Sko, as that was the last thing that she was
planning on doing. He told the trio he thinks it's also likely that she
is looking for the other parts of this staff.

#### Qa'lir

The trio met Qa'lir in the Renaura's Castle's throne room. Lord Telnetar
was found weeping in the room obeying her commands.

She wore the symbol of Elydir with an addition of a broken rope above
and a broken chain below. She looks identical to Qa'por.

Qa'lir was killed by the trio in a battle in the Renaura's Castle's
throne room. On her body, they found a sending stone with the same
symbol.

#### Qa'por

The trio saw Qa'por at the orcish camp in Renaura, her tent showing the
symbol of Eldyir with an addition of a broken rope above and a broken
chain below, like Qa'lir did. She looks identical to Qa'lir.

#### Morcanloth

The trio met Morcanloth disguised as an elf called Banir on the Lunar
Allure. At the Cavern of Stars, he forces the characters to find out
where the Orb of Empathy is from Faurin.

The trio think he might be a demon as he was unable to enter the Cavern
of Stars.

#### Faurin

Elmond, Meriele and Aseir fought and defeated Faruin's ghost in the Tomb
of the Last Rehani. His grave was translated as _Vanquisher of Elydir_
from the ancient language it was written in.

They travelled to Mount Celestia where they found Faurin in the Cavern
of Stars. He told them about his history with Elydir, how he locked her
away in the wilderness tower, and how he had spent the rest of his life
trying to find a way to stop her but failed to do so.

#### King Morcant

The ruler of Renaura. For a time, the throne had been taken from him by
Lord Telnetar. The trio were told by his daughter, that he was returning
from in hiding after being overthrown by Lord Telnetar.

#### Lord Telnetar

While enthralled by Qa'lir, Lord Telnetar overthrew the King Morcant and
was a puppet ruler for Qa'lir.

The trio heard from Pertana that he exiled himself from the city as he
felt he was weak in fighting against Qa'lir.

#### Lady Pertana

Lady Pertana is ruling in stead of King Morcant, until he returns.
During the time where the King Morcant was overthrown by the enthralled
Lord Telnetar, Lady Pertana worked with Lord Farnit in rebellion as the
Watchers.

### Locations

#### City of Renaura

The city ruled by King Morcant. An ancient city, once prosperous, it has
recently gone through tumultuous times as the king, King Morcant was
overthrown by Lord Telnetar.

Here there are lots of places the characters have visited:

- The Dragon's Claw
- Temple to Ilmater
- Lady Pertana's mansion
- Renaura's castle

#### Village of Ameluma

An elven village, destroyed by Qa'por. The inhabitants were saved by the
trio, who fled to Renaura.

A house here had Elydir's symbol decorating it.

#### Mount Renau

The tallest mountain in the Renaurian mountain range. The city of
Renaura is in the foothills of the mountain.

#### Cloudpeak Monastery

A monastery, near the top of Mount Renau, lead by Xolbi.

#### Lonely Tower

The trio were brought to this tower by their dreams and first met Elydir
here.

#### Tomb of the Last Rehani

A tomb of the ancient kings of Renau. The characters found Elydir's
amulet here, in the tomb of _Faurin, Vanquisher of Elydir_.

#### Lunia, Mount Celestia

Lunia, in the plane of Mount Celestia (known as heaven to many), is a
land of eternal twilight. The characters travelled here to find Faurin
as the prophecy.

### Items

#### Elydir's amulet

An amulet that the characters returned to Elydir, in the Lonely Tower,
on her request. She disappeared when it was returned to her.

#### Prophecy

The prophecy, as it was found on the tapestry in the village of Ameluma.

> <span class="invisible">When</span> she tricks <span class="invisible">the wandering</span> three to unbind,<br>
> The shadow <span class="invisible"> of her</span> lover will fight but fail.<br>
> When she <span class="invisible">brings</span> destruction to <span class="invisible">all of his</span> kind,<br> > <span class="invisible">The</span> soul of her <span class="invisible">lover her end</span> will detail.<br> > <span class="invisible">Now the</span> wandering three <span class="invisible">his</span> soul they <span class="invisible">must find</span><br>

The characters found out the full text from an elf that they saved from
Ameluma.

> When she tricks the wandering three to unbind,<br>
> The shadow of her lover will fight but fail.<br>
> When she brings destruction to all of his kind,<br>
> The soul of her lover her end will detail.<br>
> Now the wandering three his soul they must find,<br>
> On divine slopes her fate his soul will unveil.

#### Staff of Skonarith

Faurin told the trio of the staff of Skonarith. It was created by a
powerful magician and was split into three parts after he was defeated.

_Sko_, the Staff of Domination. Faurin thinks that it is likely that
Elydir has finally got Sko, as it was her goal to do so.

_Nar_, the Braces of Independence. The location of this is currently
unknown.

_Ith_, the Orb of Empathy. The characters have found the Orb of
Empathy.

## The sessions

### Session one: Finding Elydir's amulet

<div class="subheading">5th October, 2018 — Chester</div>

Meriele, Elmon, and Prince Aseir travelled to a wilderness tower.
Meriele and Aseir were brought by their dreams, Elmon invited by
letter. The tower stood alone in a hilly moors with no windows or
doors, apart from the carved outline of a door.

Meriele, Elmon, and Prince Aseir, solved the puzzle the password.
Shouting _Unbind_ together unlocked the tower, and followed the
staircase up to the top, where they were welcomed by an elderly elf
called Elydir, in a well furnished office.

Here, she asked them to return a stolen family heirloom, an amulet, to
her. She knew it was in the Tomb of the Last Rehani. She explains that
the amulet has a symbol of the sun setting on it with a dagger facing
down to the horizon. This is in exchange for a reward of 500gp of
treasure and precious stones. She doesn't know exactly where the tomb
is but does know it's near Renaura.

The characters set of to Renaura to see if they could find information
about the tomb. At the city, the characters found clues for the
whereabouts of the tomb:

- the barkeep of The Dragon's Claw warned the trio about goblins that
  used the entrance as a hideout, and that a scholar had gone missing
  recently
- the librarian gave directions to the tomb but that one of his
  apprentices hadn't returned from there recently, asking for them to
  find her
- and the priest, Wurcon, and the temple scholar Glanna, pointed to
  where it was on a map and gave a small amount of history on it.

The characters stayed the night at the castle, meeting some of the
city's higher class before moving out to the tomb.

Arriving at the tomb, they quickly dispatched of the goblins, solved
the door puzzle and then started slowly exploring the tomb, eventually
venturing into the formidable main chamber. In this chamber they found
the slain body of the apprentice and a translation of some of the
rooms in the tomb. Once entering this room, however, they awoke the
skeletons within and were attacked. Managing to fight these off, the
escaped the great chamber.

The character notice that a room on the map has been translated to say
_Faurin, Vanquisher of Elydir_, and recognising choose to travel to this
room.After some more exploration and fighting, they eventually find
Faurin's tomb. In this room, the characters feel cold and a sense of
uneasy sadness and unfulfillment. After opening the coffin and taking
the amulet, the door to the tomb slams shut. A pale white figure appears
between the characters and the door It said, sorrowfully, ‘That amulet
must stay here. I cannot let you leave with it or knowledge of it. I’m
sorry. I’m sorry.’ The trio defeat this being and leave the tomb.

They return to Elydir's tower after making a copy of the amulet, and try
to give the copy to Elidyir. She demands the proper amulet, and when
it's given to her, disappears instantaneously from the room, leaving the
reward behind.

### Session two: Overthrowing Lord Telnetar

<div class="subheading">26th January, 2019 — Brockweir</div>

The trio parts ways for a few months until an intriguing letter is
sent to each of them, asking for them to meet in the Watchers Tavern
in Jairt, near Renaura.

In this tavern, they meet a woman who talks to them about recent
events in Renaura where Lord Telnetar has supplanted the previous King
Morcant and has been tyrannically ruling the city since. She asks them
to find out what Telnetar is doing and to put a stop to it, in
exchange for a reward. The characters accept this and, once again, set
of to Renaura.

They head to the temple and find that Wurcon, the priest, is arguing
with some guards about Glanna being arrested, hearing that she has
been taken to the Telnetar's mansion. Heading there, they kill the
guards outside. Exploring the mansion, they find: Glanna locked up in
the basement, guarded by a wight and two cultists; lots of zombies;
and servants in the bedroom. In the basement, the characters heard the
cultists mention that, during the following day, something was going
to happen, though it wasn't clear what that was.

It's here that they find a small wooden box with an inscription on it,
containing a small orb which was wrapped in a cloth map showing an
alternative way into the castle.

Glanna takes the trio to Pertana's mansion, a base for the small
rebellion against Telnetar. She explains that, during one of the first
nights that Telnetar had become the leader, his family had been taken
from the mansion. Rather than being taken to the castle, as expected,
they were taken to a warehouse.

Pertana convinced the characters to go to the mansion in an attempt to
rescue the family, hoping they might be able to find out more
information about what happened to the city. The _warehouse incident_
happened.

After this, the trio travelled to the castle, using the clifftop
entrance to get in. Arriving in a large cave with a bridge across a
ravine with a door on the other side. Statues animate when they try to
cross the bridge and they realise they must kneel to be let past. At
the far end, they use the orb from the small wooden box, to unlock the
doors. Behind the doors are stairs.

The trio follow the stairs up where they arrive in a small, dark room,
from which they can see through small slits in the wall into the
throne room. In the throne room, they can hear a man weeping. They
open a door to the throne room using a lever. When the man sees them,
he stands and shouts “You shouldn’t be here. Leave! Run!”

As this happens, a figure appears and pushes him back onto his chair.
She had a obsidian skin with dark blue streaks with a finely chiseled
face on her cloak she had a symbol of a sun with a dagger in front of
it emblazoned on her cloak, much like the one on Elydir's amulet. She
introduces herself as Qa'lir. Although the trio face a lot of powerful
spells, an imp, and a cloud of poison, they manage to defeat her,
though with only Meriele standing, who deals the final blow.

Meriele loots Qa'lir's body, taking diamonds and a stone engraved with
Elydir's symbol, a broken chain also engraved underneath it.

### Session three: Finding the prophecy

<div class="subheading">8th November, 2019 — Chester</div>

After spending the last week killing the monster, constructs, and
cultists which remained in the city, the characters met with Pertana.
During the meeting, they receive as screaming message from the stone
taken from Qa'lir's body which Meriele had kept secret until now -
threating them for what they had done.

Elmond suggests that they speak with the castle librarian, where they
find that the stone is a _sending stone_. Additionally, he identifies
the main symbol on the stone as the symbol of the Glynlamin family and
their historic relations between them and the Rehani. The elvish
village of the Glynlamin is across the mountain pass.

The characters took a short rest in the Dragon's Claw for some food
and sleep - Meriele avoids people, Aseir tries to rendezvous with
Glanna, and Elmon performs for the occupants. Then, after finding some
winter gear from Cheda and finding rumours about Aymeluma which there
were little of them to tell, they travelled across the mountain pass -
fighting with wolves.

Once across the other side, they saw the village in the distance.
Smoke and blood - not good. Aseir rode on ahead to the decimated empty
village and Meriele looked out, climbing a tree. Together, Aseir and
Meriele saved a young elvish child, terrified of the monsters that took
her family. Elond explored a building marked with the symbol of
Elydir, finding a half destroyed poem on the walls.

Hearing distant shouting, the characters headed out in search. They
found the source, an Orcish campsite, a lavish tent marked with the
symbol of Elydir guarded. Cages filled with elves were beside the camp,
one of the elves looking strikingly similar to Elydir. Elmond tricked
most of the orcs way with illusions and Aseir and Meriele killed the
rest of the orcs. They freed the elves and Elmond left an illusion of
tents behind. Meriele looked into the tent but didn't find out much
information, and then returned to the village with the others.

The party organised an escape for the elves from their village to
Renaura. Speaking to the elf that looked like Elydir, the characters
find out that Elydir was understood to be killed years ago after a grave
betrayal. The elf gave the party the full prophecy of which they had
found a part. They find out the name of their kidnapper - Qa'por.

Hearing shouting and screaming in the distance, from the orc camp, the
characters returned, ready to fight Qa'por. They arrived at the camp,
burning, orcs dying at a single word from Qa'por. Before the characters
could react, she disappears.

Following the prophecy, the characters hashed out a plan to travel up to
the mountain, to the Cloudpeak Monastery, in seek of divine slopes. They
rested for the night in the ruins of the village and headed up the
mountain the following day.

After a long journey, they reached the cloudpeak monastery, initially
appearing derelict. They meet Xolbi and find out he is a silver dragon.
He understands the meaning of "divine slopes" in the prophecy, but will
only help them if they first find a stolen crown.

The characters are teleported back to Renarua by Xolbi, also providing
the glyphs to return. With the help of Meriele, the characters found the
thieves who stole the crown and return to the Cloudpeak Monastery,
teleported by Wurcon - though not before Aseir was rejected by Glanna,
yet again.

Returning the crown to Xolbi, he let them know that a portal will open
that night to Mount Celestia, at the top of Mount Renau. He keeps the
weather calm to help them travel up the mountain.

On the way up, they met a monk who had fallen while on his pilgrimage to
the top. They help him up the hill, letting him take a horseback.
Reaching the top, the characters waited until the moon was overhead.

As the moon reached its peak, the wind calm and the air warmed - a
silvery pool appeared. The monk transformed into a Deva and thanked the
characters for their help, before letting them pass into the portal.

The characters, hand in hand, jumped into the pool together,
apprehensive of what they might find on the other side.
