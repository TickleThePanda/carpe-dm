## City of Renaura

### The noble houses of Renaura

There are three noble houses of Renaura. Each have held their family
positions for a long time and have prospered under the rule of the
Morcants.

#### The noble house of Telnetar

The family of Telnetar were some of the earlier supporters of the
Morcant's and have maintained a very close relationship with the crown.
They were a rich merchant family, focussing on rich foods and drinks.

The leader of the Telnetar, Meneri Telnetar is currently controlled by
Qa'lir.

#### The noble house of Farnit

The family of Farnit own multiple mines, ranging from economic metals to
precious metals and stones.

#### The noble house of Pertana

The family of Perthana own a large amount of the land.

### From a distance

> Nestled in a steep valley is a small city: the valley's impassable
> natural walls overshadowing the natural ones. There's a castle
> burrowed into the top reaches where the surrounding mountains draw
> closest. A single gatehouse guards the walls that span the bottom of
> the steep valley.

### Approaching the city

> As you approach the city, you can see that the walls scarred and worn,
> some newer stonework replaces sections.
>
> A steady flow of people are passing in and out of the gates. A couple
> of bored looking guards standing on either side, almost ignoring the
> small rabble.

Anyone who wants to know the history of the city and makes a successful
DC 15 Intelligence (History) check knows that it's an ancient city that
was, through sheer force of will, invaded over 300 years ago, the old
royal family was forced into marriage into the new lords.

The guards give the characters no trouble entering the city.

### Entering the gates

> You've passed through the city gates. A busy main street climbs up.
> Behind the stone houses that are set against the mountainside, you can
> see the tops of the castle's towers.
>
> The street, leading to the city's square, is lined with an assortment
> of busy market stalls. Farmers and merchants are bartering. A
> procession of robed figures part the crowd, walking away from you
> towards the centre of the city. Guards wander, chatting with
> merchants, watching the stalls.

Here the characters have a whole range of options for finding out where
the tomb is:

- merchants will point the characters towards March, the bar–keep at
  _The Dragon's Claw_ which is ‘just up the road — the bar–keep there
  talks about mad things like this’, if they're convinced by the
  characters
- guards will point the characters towards the scholar, Ret, who works
  in the castle library, if they're convinced by the characters
- priests will welcome the characters to join their procession to the
  Temple of Ilmater where the scholarly acolytes might know of such a
  place
- general populace will be relatively helpful, pointing the characters
  straight to March _The Dragon's Claw_

### Temple of Ilmater

> In the centre of the city's square, there's a large round building.
> Outside, there's a statue of a bound man on his knees weeping. The
> figure is scarred and his limbs are at unsettling angles. On it, in
> common, is inscribed:
>
> > We welcome all to the house of Ilmater.

At the temple, the characters will be encouraged by a greeter, who will
introduce themselves as Wurcon, to pray.

The temple has a scholar that knows of the local tombs. Wurcon will take
the characters to the her in the "records" room further in the temple.

> Wurcon pushes a small door open that takes you into a small room small
> room, only a few feet wide, lit by candles. The room has a few
> bookcases in it, with scrolls and tomes on their shelves.
>
> Despite you entering the room rather loudly, a young woman who is
> hunched at the desk, has not looked up from the scroll she was
> reading. Next to her is a discarded plate of bread and cheese.
>
> "Glanna. Glanna? Glanna! Hey! We have some travellers looking for some
> information about a nearby Tomb and I was hoping you could help them."
>
> It seems to take her a little to return to the world from the text,
> and she still glances back to it.

The scholar will help the characters but won't do it gladly. She will be
sharp with them and not really going too much out of her way to give
them information.

The scholar, sighing, will find a map and will point the characters to
the correct place on a map. She knows a little of the history of the
tombs.

> This is to the Tomb of the Last Rehani where the old Kings are buried
> — this is from before our current rulers, the Morcants came here.
> Unfortunately — we those who worship Ilmater (the God of Endurance) —
> we're not that good at keeping detailed records of history.
>
> From my study of our small collection of histories, I can tell you
> that their rule was tumultuous. There were different powers at play
> within the city leaders. I think that lead to their declining power
> and, ultimately, to the marriage of their daughter with the Morcant
> family.
>
> I'm sorry I can't be any more helpful with the details here.
>
> You're welcome to read through the books on history that we have here
> but I don't think you'll find much more than I've given you. If you do
> choose to do so, I'd prefer for you to go elsewhere so as not to cause
> any more distraction to me.

### The Dragon's Claw

> Fighting away the cold, a roaring fire crackles. The funk of pipe weed
> smoke and stale beer linger. There are a few people sitting around the
> inn: a small group of younger men are playing dice, a hooded figure
> watching the door from an alcove, a woman hunched at the bar.
>
> Behind the bar a balding man with silver hair is cleaning tankards.

At the inn, the bar–keep, March, will very gladly welcome the characters
to sit at the almost–empty bar and to have a drink. He will gladly tell
mildly accurate stories about a nearby tomb.

> I don't know of the Tomb of the Last Rehani but there is an old tomb
> outside the city. The old Lords of this city are buried there.
>
> Ooooohhh, there's lots of rumours about this place. Some people say
> it's haunted by a ghost sworn to protect it. Others say that the dead
> themselves walk the halls. I know that a scholar from the castle
> library went there recently never to return.
>
> I doubt it's _the dead_ that got her, though. Much more likely that
> it's the goblins that use the place as a hide–out. I know that's not a
> rumour! They don't really cause a problem to the people in the city so
> the Lord here hasn't done anything about them.

He continues to ramble about the troubles that the goblins cause to the
farmers.

### The castle's library

> As your tiring journey takes you higher up the city, closer to the
> castle, the become closer together, making the city narrower. Closest
> to the castle, the path follows the side of one of the valley walls
> with large mansions on the other side.
>
> Eventually, you pass the last building and ahead of you are the walls
> to the castle. These walls stretch across the valley from one side to
> another, though that space is now only 50 ft.
>
> Behind the walls you can see a stone castle with two towers at the
> front. Layers continue behind it, each one building on the mountain's
> incline.
>
> The path takes you to the centre of this wall to a gatehouse. There
> are 4 guards standing at this entrance. They are suspicious of the
> characters and will not want to let them through the gate.

They can be, amongst other things:

- bribed for 20gp
- intimidated DC 20
- persuaded DC 25

The characters will be let into the castle on the condition of being
escorted.

> The guard takes you through the gate into a courtyard and gardens, the
> castle about 60ft away from you. In the centre is a fountain, although
> there's no water flowing.
>
> Here, you can only see the front of the castle, a round tower built up
> against the walls of the mountain. Large carved wooden doors are
> closed at the front, a guard standing on either side.
>
> There's almost a direct path along the middle towards the wooden doors
> but the guard takes you around to the right, following the valley's
> wall, taking you to a smaller side entrance with little ornamentation.
>
> You're taken through some narrow stone servant corridors through to a
> library, just off a well decorated main corridor.
>
> The large room is filled with books and scrolls. Every accessible
> _inch_ of the room is taken up by shelves with the narrowest of spaces
> between them.
>
> A man dressed in robes is moving books to what somebody _might_ call a
> desk, although it could just be more storage.
>
> He happily gasps as you walk in, smiling.

He will explain to the players about the tomb's location and how to get
there, although that they don't know much about it now — the mad King
Bleiduid Morcant a few generations ago demanded the burning of anything
about the Rehanis. He will explain that one of his apprentices went
there a few weeks ago but never returned, which he sounds very sad
about. He will ask them to see if they can find this apprentice.

## The Castle

The castle's wall is guarded by eight guards.

Inside the rest of the castle are various rooms with animated armour,
fanatics and wights.

### Path to the secret entrance

This cave entrance can be seen with a telescope or similar object from
distance.

The characters will have to find a way to get up to the cave entrance
which is 150ft up the cliff or 50ft across the cliff.

If they have the appropriate gear, they will be able to do it without
any checks.

### Cave entrance

> The cave is damp and slippery. It looks like it's been hewn from the
> rock. There is no light and the you can't see the end.

At the end of the passage, the characters can see it open out into the
bridge across the chasm.

### Bridge across the chasm

> From earlier in the passage, you could have mistakenly think this
> opened into a room. It is, however, a huge chasm. On both your side
> and the other side there's a balcony about 50 feet across, with
> balustrades on the sides. Across the middle is a bridge that's 10 feet
> across and about 40 feet long. The bridge doesn't have any railing.
>
> To the left and right of the bridge on both balconies, statues look
> ahead with swords held out.
>
> At the far end is a door, in front of which is a small obelisk.

The statues will wake (Animated Armour) unless the characters bow to
them. If the characters bow to them after they wake, they will return to
their guarding positions.

When the players reach the obelisk:

> The obelisk has a small rounded indent at the top.

The key (the small orb) must be placed on the top of the obelisk for the
door to open. The characters will hear a click when they put it on top
of the obelisk.

Behind the door is a spiral staircase that leads upwards.

### Up to the castle

A spiral staircase takes the characters upwards. When the reach the top
of the spiral staircase, they will reach a wall with a lever. The wall
will have small eye holes that the characters can see through which they
will see by the light coming out of them. They will be able to hear a
man weeping.

The characters will be able to see through the holes in the wall a
throne room, with torches on the wall. A man is on a throne, weeping.

Pulling the lever will cause the wall to slide open, causing a loud
scraping sound.

This wall will reveal the throne room.

### The throne room

> The throne room is set up for dining, full of tables and chairs. There
> is nobody else in the room apart from the weeping man. At the far end
> of the room is a set of double doors.
>
> The scraping noise of the wall opening will cause the man to jump up
> in surprise. He will shout "You shouldn't be here. Leave! Run!"
>
> The moment he shouts that, you hear a loud crack and a cloaked figure
> appears, pushing the man back into his throne. She has a chiseled face
> is obsidian with dark blue streaks and she has white hair. She has a
> symbol of a sun emblazoned on her cloak with a dagger in front of it.
>
> The figure laughs and with an elvish accent says, "Shut up old man."
>
> "Now, now, this _is_ a surprise. I heard you were in the city, Elmon,
> Meriele, and Aseir. Rumours of your destruction in the city over the
> last few days have reached my ears. I wasn't expecting to find you
> right in here, though!
>
> "Let me introduce myself, I am Qa'lir Olinarelidyr." She bows. "I am
> glad to be finally meeting you. You see, I am in great debt to you,
> it's through your actions that I can be here today.
>
> "Please! Sit! I'll call the servants in and they can bring us some
> food."

If the characters don't sit, she will start walking towards them the
torches in the room will flicker, she will raise her hand towards them
and shout "I will enjoy destroying you. Hahahahahaha!"

If the characters do sit:

> She claps and two wights come in through the doors at the end of the
> throne room.
>
> "It's my honour to represent Elidyr in this city. She sent me here to
> take the city. The destruction that I've been able to cause."
>
> She smirks and laughs.
>
> "With you here now, I would like to make you an offer. I've seen what
> havoc you can wreak.
>
> "Join me, swear allegiance to Elidyr. We can cause so much
> devastation."

If the players refuse to join her, she will cast cloudkill on where the
players are and misty step away.

### The Castle Library

Info about Elydir's history and nearby elven village, Aymeluma, from the
symbol that they show the. The symbol that he knows of doesn't include
the chain.

Things that the castle librarian knows:

- Aymeluma is lead by the Glynlamin family.
- The location of the village, on the other side of the mountains. The
  options to get there: the mountain pass that gets there, which should
  take less than a day; or the roads around the mountains that would
  take a week instead.
- There's an ancient connection between the city and the elven village.
  The eldest son of King Rehani was meant to marry an elf from there
  but that was before the Morcant family took over rule from the Rehani.

### Ironwood Street hideout

Ironwood Street is a small back-ally of a much larger road in the city.

A symbol shown to the players by Xolbi can be found here, and it marks
the location of the hideout. This can be found using a DC 16 perception
check, or by using thieves cant.

> The entrance to the hideout is a small door which is locked that
> requires a DC 18 check to unlock it, or a DC 15 Strength check.
>
> This opens out into a small, 15ft by 20ft room. The room has a table,
> and a chair and the floor is covered in straw. At the other end of the
> room is a staircase that leads down, torches on the walls.
>
> A cloaked man stands in the room with a knife out, liquid glistens on
> the blade.

This man is an assassin who will defend the stairwell.

> This door leads into a brightly lit room. The room is rectangular and
> is 20 ft on the side you just entered on, and 30ft long. Along the
> walls are sconces filled with flame.
>
> There are two podiums in the room, one 5ft away from you, the other
> 5ft away from the other wall. The closest podium has a glass orb on
> it.
>
> At the other end of the room, there is a stone doorway but no handle
> or keyhole.

There's a door at the other end of the room which will be opened if the
orb is moved from one podium to the other.

When the orb is removed, the characters must succeed on a DC 22
Dexterity saving throw or else be thrown to a random place in the room.
The person holding the orb must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving
throw or else drop and smash the orb.

In the room behind the door, there's 200gp, an antique carved wood
plate, inlaid with bone (40gp), a sturdy alabaster figurine of a tower,
set with a chalcedony (80gp), and a durable adamantine bowl, inlaid with
platinum (500gp). On top of the pile is a simple golden crown, which is
the Rehani crown.
