> It's been a week since you have freed the City of Renaura from
> Qa'lir's control. Since then, you've been paid a 250gp each to help
> secure the city from the creatures remaining here and the castle.
> You've made good progress and are to meet with Lady
> Pertana, who is still ruling the city in the place of King
> Morcant. During this time you've seen a lot of things:
> constructs made by Qa'lir fight anything around them; stationed wights
> murder innocents; and lots of fleeing cultists
>
> Right now, you're in Lady Pertana's study discussing the progress
> in protecting the city. Pertana is sitting at her desk. There are
> papers piled and an empty glass of wine. Her eyes are bloodshot and
>
> "We've been able to bring in some more of our guards from the
> surrounding areas," Pertana says. "We've seen an abatement in the
> reports of bandit and goblin attack which is a great relief.
>
> "I'm very grateful for the work that you've been putting in over the
> past week. Without your help, I'm doubtful that the city will have
> survived.

> "Since the attack, we've been able to gather from our prisoners that

> A piercing screech interrupts Pertana, "for what you have done -
> Meriele, Elmon, and Aseir - you will know _only_ pain."

> You each hear a whisper of a discordant melody and are wracked with a

At this point, ask the characters to make a Wisdom Saving Throw (DC 19).
On a failed save, the characters take 5d6 psychic damage. On a
successful save, the characters take half.

> Pertana is standing and looking shocked and concerned but looks

### The Letter

<blockquote class="letter">

Meet at the Watcher's Tavern in Jairnt, North of Renaura, on the night
of the next new moon. There's a matter to discuss that affects many
people's lives. I can provide you with a significant reward if you
agree to help. Please be discrete.

Bring Elmon and Meriele.

</blockquote>

> You've heard news and rumours or a recent deposition of King Morcant,
> the old leader of the City of Renaura.

#### The petitioner

> After a few minutes in the tavern, a tall hooded figure wearing a worn
> traveller's cloak approaches from one of the corners. The figure takes
> a chair from a neighbouring table, and places it at yours, immediately
> sitting. The figure, in a graceful voice, says, "Good evening, Prince
> Aseir, Elmon, and Meriele. I'm glad to see that you've answered my
> request to discuss a matter with you."
>
> From the voice, you can tell that this person is unmistakably a woman

The woman's petition to the character's:

> The city's previous leader, King Morcant, has been supplanted by Lord
> Telnetar. Telnetar was once the leader of one of the three great noble
> houses in Renaura. The two remaining major noble houses in Renaura
> have stayed quiet and kept to their own business.
>
> It's odd, because Telnetar, when he was a noble was good-hearted and
> sociable. Now, he rarely leaves the castle and gives tyrannical and
> harsh orders to quash any opposition to his rule. The people of the
> city are living and acting out of fear.
>
> My request of you, adventurers, is that you find out what Telnetar is
> doing and put a stop to it. You must stick together and be discrete or
> I think it is likely that you will be doomed to fail.

The petitioner is Juvia, the daughter of King Morcant, well versed in
the politics of the city, poised to be the next Lord of the city. She
fled with her father during Telnetar's violent coup, after they saw the
power in their assailants.

She is a 5th-level School of Evocation Wizard. Her intelligence score is
17, intelligence modifier +3, spell save DC 14, spell attack modifier
+6.

The sort of information this person knows:

- the locations of the nobles' mansions.
- information about the current nobles and which ones are most likely
  to help the characters.
- the direction to the city.
- _reluctant_: her own identity, she fears that, if the characters find
  out who she is, her family may be persecuted. She will explain to the
  characters that she's worried about the knowledge causing harm to
  others if pressed for an answer.
- _reluctant_: the location of her father, King Morcant, and the rest
  of his family.
- _reluctant_: how she knows the characters, she met them when they
  visited the city and was awed by Prince Aseir's stories.

The characters can identifier her if they succeed on a DC 16
Investigation check, if they have previously met King Morcant in his
castle for a banquet. If the characters verbally identify her in a way
that's heard, they will be assaulted on the way to Renaura by five
bandits who demand more information from the characters.

She will give them 100gp each for the troubles so far.

### Elydir and the OlinarElydir

Since her escape using her amulet, Elydir's has been planning to release
great evil on the world as revenge for her prolonged imprisonment. The
characters will remember the symbol on her amulet as a rising sun behind
a dagger pointing down <small>(this was not revealed to the players in
[Unbound](/adventures/unbound/plan/) but the characters will recognise
it)</small>.

![Elydir's symbol showing a rising sun behind a dagger pointing
down](/images/Elydirs-symbol.svg)

Elydir works in total secrecy, concealing her location with magic. She
commands two loyal spellcasters _Qa'lir_ and _Qa'por_, known to her as
the _OlinarElydir_. Qa'lir and Qa'por are twins. They are know to common
folk as "The Vanquished Fist".

### OlinarElydir

The OlinarElydir have been tasked with
bringing Ternia under her control. Elydir communicates with the
OlinarElydir using sending stones, each carved with Elydir's
symbol and their own.

### The City of Renaura

The prosperity of Renaura has now passed. The influence of Qa'lir has
spread corruption in almost all parts of the city.

### The Deposition of King Morcant

Qa'lir arrived in Renaura and quickly garnered respect as a rich
merchant with the nobles. She quickly became close to Telnetar,
eventually casting a spell to force Telnetar to do her bidding and
threatening Telnetar's family.

Qa'lir spent the next few weeks building a new guard force for Telnetar.
Buying some of them, threatening some of them, and replacing some by
apprentice spell casters. She personally replaced the old guard captain

King Morcant had regular meetings with Telnetar, and Qa'lir used this to
stage the coup. Telnetar, attending this meeting bringing his guards
along, citing a recent attempt against his life, and was allowed to keep
the guards with him.

When the Telnetar and the guards arrived for the meeting in the castle's
parlour, they immediately fought King Morcant's guards, attempting to
kill the Lord. Qa'lir and the replaced guards used dark magic during the
fight. Telnetar, realising a flaw in the magic that was binding him to
Qa'lir's magic, told King Morcant to flee during the fight. King
Morcant, realising the threat, fled with his family.

### The Kidnapping of Telnetar's Family

After Telnetar's disobedience to Qa'lir, Qa'lir ordered Telnetar's
family to be kidnapped to ensure Telnetar's good behaviour.

### Qa'lir in Renaura

Qa'lir's servants are _wights_.

Qa'lir has spies throughout all parts of the city, from beggars to
servants in the remaining noble's houses. It only takes hours for
displays of rebellion to reach the ears of Qa'lir. These spies have been
bribed or threatened by Qa'lir's servants.

### Guards

One of Qa'lir's first director orders through Telnetar as a puppet was
to replace the head of the guard with one of her _wight_ servants,
Kexor. One of Kexor's first orders was to kidnap Telnetar's family.

In general, the guards now live in fear of Lord Telnetar and Kexor where
before they were happy to serve. Severe disobedience usually leads to
corporal or capital punishment. The guards are rarely used by the city
government to prevent crime but instead are used to prevent the uprising
of the people.

Guards are rarely punished for villainy and some (roughly 3/10) are
revelling in it.

A rare few very good natured guards (roughly 1/10) will be willing to
help the characters, especially if they see something that makes them
realise the corruption. These guards will usually do it privately
fearing the other guards. Most will be caught at some point.

The remaining guards will follow most commands from their superiors out
of fear.

### Civilians

Crime is now rife in the city, though very little of it is organised.
Qa'lir has killed or threatened most of the gangs within the city.

Between harassment from guards and the rising crime in the city, most of
the civilians are downtrodden. A lot of civilians believe that Telnetar
was just waiting to seize the opportunity to take the city.
