### Session 1 - 15th June 2022

Recap for the characters:

> We have the characters:
>
> - Shadow Vulture, a human rogue - James
> - Lael Umelee - Jess
> - Rudi Lanniter - Jim
> - Merlin - Mark
> - Thio - Nathan
>
> While waiting to meet Lady Alymir Glynlamin, you answered a cry for help to
> the north of the village - wolves were attacking. You successfully killed the
> wolves attacking the farm - though in the process, Lael's father, Kendel, got
> hurt.
>
> You took Kendel into the village where a crowd of elves were gathered, eager
> to help after the fight. The healer helped Kendel and Lael.
>
> Lael's other father, Toross, was knocking on the door to Lady Glynlamin's
> house, asking for her help and leadership. When she exited her house, she
> looked ill and shaken.
>
> She invited you in and asked if you would find the source of the wolves in the
> Forest of Beasts and stop it, if you can. You learnt from her that the attacks
> only started happening recently, that the forest is hard to track through, and
> it's difficult to travel at night.
>
> After a short rest, you found wolf tracks at the entrance to the forest and
> were able to follow them. You were attacked by more wolves, which you fought
> off. You continued to successfully follow the tracks and reached a footpath
> crossing the wolf tracks. Lael found a scrap of dirty cloth on the footpath.
>
> Which way do you go to continue the journey?

So far, they have travelled 2.5 miles to their destination.

### Session 2 - 22th June 2022

Recap for the characters:

> You followed the path in each direction and found traps. Thankfully, the keen
> eyed Merlin saw the holes before you fell in them.
>
> Lael led you in the wrong direction but the others managed to get you back on
> track.
>
> Some bandits were in your way and you quickly dispatched them.
>
> You crossed a river using a rope you fired across to support yourselves -
> thankfully nobody fell down the waterfall.
>
> The sun was setting as you came across a large crater with a giant oak tree in
> it. You managed to fight most of the wolves off from a distance. The ones who
> got closer took out Thio who incredibly managed to get back up and Lael who
> was healed after the fight.
>
> Inside the oak tree, you heard two women arguing, one begging for protection,
> and the other coldly refusing it. After entering, you quickly fought the druid
> woman who was protecting wolves - with Merlin throwing a huge orb of thunder
> at the woman. While the remaining wolves managed to knock Lael and Thio
> unconscious, you killed them and made the tree safe.
>
> You found some treasure in the giant tree, including a gold oak leaf on Briid.
>
> What do you do now?
