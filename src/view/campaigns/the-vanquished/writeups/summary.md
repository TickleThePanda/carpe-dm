>
> While waiting to meet Lady Alymir Glynlamin, you answered a cry for
> help to the north of the village - wolves were attacking. You
> successfully killed the wolves attacking the farm - though in the
> process, Lael's father, Kendel, got hurt.
>
> You took Kendel into the village where a crowd of elves were gathered,
> eager to help after the fight. The healer helped Kendel and Lael.
>
> Lael's other father, Toross, was knocking on the door to Lady
> Glynlamin's house, asking for her help and leadership. When she
> exited her house, she looked ill and shaken.
>
> She invited you in and asked if you would find the source of the
> wolves in the Forest of Beasts and stop it, if you can. You learnt
> from her that the attacks only started happening recently, that the
> forest is hard to track through, and it's difficult to travel at
> night.
>
> After a short rest, you found wolf tracks at the entrance to the
> forest and were able to follow them. You were attacked by more wolves,
> which you fought off. You continued to successfully follow the tracks
> and reached a footpath crossing the wolf tracks. Lael found a scrap
> of dirty cloth on the footpath.
>
> Which way do you go to continue the journey?

So far, they have travelled 2.5 miles to their destination.
