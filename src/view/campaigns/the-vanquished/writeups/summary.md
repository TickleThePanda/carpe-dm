### Session 1 - 15th June 2022

Recap for the characters:

> We have the characters:
>
> - Shadow Vulture, a human rogue - James
> - Lael Umelee - Jess
> - Rudi Lanniter - Jim
> - Merlot - Mark
> - Thio - Nathan
>
> While waiting to meet Lady Alymir Glynlamin, you answered a cry for help to
> the north of the village - wolves were attacking. You successfully killed the
> wolves attacking the farm - though in the process, Lael's father, Kendel, got
> hurt.
>
> You took Kendel into the village where a crowd of elves were gathered, eager
> to help after the fight. The healer helped Kendel and Lael.
>
> Lael's other father, Toross, was knocking on the door to Lady Glynlamin's
> house, asking for her help and leadership. When she exited her house, she
> looked ill and shaken.
>
> She invited you in and asked if you would find the source of the wolves in the
> Forest of Beasts and stop it, if you can. You learnt from her that the attacks
> only started happening recently, that the forest is hard to track through, and
> it's difficult to travel at night.
>
> After a short rest, you found wolf tracks at the entrance to the forest and
> were able to follow them. You were attacked by more wolves, which you fought
> off. You continued to successfully follow the tracks and reached a footpath
> crossing the wolf tracks. Lael found a scrap of dirty cloth on the footpath.
>
> Which way do you go to continue the journey?

So far, they have travelled 2.5 miles to their destination.

### Session 2 - 22th June 2022

Recap for the characters:

> You followed the path in each direction and found traps. Thankfully, the keen
> eyed Merlot saw the holes before you fell in them.
>
> Lael led you in the wrong direction but the others managed to get you back on
> track.
>
> Some bandits were in your way and you quickly dispatched them.
>
> You crossed a river using a rope you fired across to support yourselves -
> thankfully nobody fell down the waterfall.
>
> The sun was setting as you came across a large crater with a giant oak tree in
> it. You managed to fight most of the wolves off from a distance. The ones who
> got closer took out Thio who incredibly managed to get back up and Lael who
> was healed after the fight.
>
> Inside the oak tree, you heard two women arguing, one begging for protection,
> and the other coldly refusing it. After entering, you quickly fought the druid
> woman who was protecting wolves - with Merlot throwing a huge orb of thunder
> at the woman. While the remaining wolves managed to knock Lael and Thio
> unconscious, you killed them and made the tree safe.
>
> You found some treasure in the giant tree, including a gold oak leaf on Briid.
>
> What do you do now?

### Session 3 - 6th July 2022

> You were asked by Lady Glynlamin to find out the source of the wolf attacks,
> which you successfully did - it was a druid Briid, in the Forest of Beasts.
>
> You travelled back from the giant tree and arrived back at the village,
> finding that Lady Glynlamin had been attacked in the night. You met the
> Council of Elders (Ilphas, Maiele, and Alasse) who asked you to investigate
> her. After you showed them the golden oak leaf, they told you about the
> Glynlamin family connection to Silvanus, about the nearby Shrine to Silvanus
> and a druid settlement to the North West.
>
> When you saw Lady Glynlamin, you saw that she showed no signs of physical
> injury but that she didn't seem herself. You Lady Glynlamin and questioned her
> about the attack. It took some work, but she was able to tell you that she was
> attacked in the night by a cloaked woman
>
> You next found wine stains leading outside and a very hungover Aien, the house
> servant for Lady Glynlamin. He admitted that he been drinking at the Easing
> Water Inn the previous night and so he missed the attack.
>
> You went to the blacksmith, she was hiding something. She was the first on the
> scene. She was reluctant to say that she saw a cloaked figure arrive at the
> Council of Elders.
>
> Brickny Spears did lots of intimidating. Shadow Vulture did a lot of window
> watching. Merlot berated the young Aien about being a bad worker. Lael is
> worried about losing her friends.

### Session 4 - 20th July 2022

Information you've found out so far:

- Lady Glynlamin was inconsolable and was talking about how she's a coward.
- Aien missed the killer. He was drinking at the Inn last night - confirmed by
  the Inn keeper.
- Aien's keys are missing.
- Stains leading out the back door of Lady Glynlamin's house.
- Orihil took Aien home one night when he was incredibly drunk.
- Blacksmith saw a cloaked figure enter the Council of Elders

> You went to the Easing Water Inn to follow up on whether Aien had been
> drinking there the previous night. In the hot springs of the Inn, you were
> attacked by a water monster and in the ensuing battle, Lael was killed.
>
> Merlot took her and Lael's fathers' mule into the Forest of Beasts to find the
> druids who might be able to help you heal her. Merlot narrowly escaped being
> eaten by spiders. After speaking with the Council of Elders, the rest of the
> party went to protect Lady Glynlamin.

### Session 5 - 27th July 2022

> You met Donkey, a druid who had been exiled from the nearby Silvanus. After
> some of you fought vine blights at the house and others fought twig blights at
> the statue of Silvanus, you confronted Lady Glynlamin about a letter that
> Merlot found at the statue. You deduced it likely wasn't written by her,
> comparing her handwriting and the signet ring.

### Session 6 - 3rd August 2022

> In a gruelling fight, you defended Lady Glynlamin's house from the attackers,
> finally killing (and unmasking) the attacker Elder Maiele. You lead the
> village to depose the other Elders and were planning to set off to find the
> druids in the Forest of Beasts. Before you left, you planted a suspicious
> letter to draw out and meet any remaining conspirators a few days from now.

### Session 7 - 10th August 2022

> You travelled to Silvat, discovering the cooling of hot springs on the way,
> avoiding getting bitten by snakes, and getting lost in a maze. Once getting to
> Silvat, you talked to the leader, Yorhorn. He agreed to revive Lael in
> recompense for the damage that Briid did to Lael's community, and if you
> agreed to investigate the waning power of the hot springs.
