## Tomb of the Last Rehani

![A map of the Tomb of the Last Rehani.](/images/unbound/tomb-reference.png)

### Travelling to the Tomb

When they reach the path, depending on what information they know.

> The old road is not easy to find — the forest reclaiming it. On each
> side of the path, a couple of stone sentinels are crumbling.
> Undergrowth covers the path and bushes are growing between the stones.

Players with a passive perception above 13 will see goblin tracks
heading along the path.

> For about an hour, the path continues overgrown, getting steeper. It
> ends where the mountain rises, a collapsed door in front of you.

### Entrance to the tomb

> At the foot of the mountain is the collapsed door.

There's a gap large enough for small creatures at the bottom, or medium
creatures with a successful Dexterity check of 15.

Some of the rubble can be shifted instead, with a successful Strength
check of 15 but it will cause some of the remaining rubble to collapse
and the goblins to be prepared

The rubble can also be climbed over with a successful Strength check of 15.

### Goblin hideout

> As you enter the corridor, the first thing that hits you is the stench
> of goblins. Fragments of the walls and ceilings lie on the floor.
> Further down the corridor, there's a small amount of light.

If the goblins know the characters are coming, then the corridor is
silent; otherwise, laughter and arguing can be heard.

> You can see a chamber ahead. At the opposite end of the chamber
> there's a set of double stone doors. In the room there's crude tables
> and chairs. A primitive wooden barricades is a couple of feet into the
> room.

If the goblins heard the characters coming, then the tables are empty
(but torches are lit), the goblins hiding behind the barricade and
walls; otherwise, goblins are at the tables and chairs, playing cards.

After combat is finished:

> Above the door is text that the players cannot understand. There are
> six orbs, three on each side of the door. Above the door are six
> lines, each with a dot at the end.

```
.          .
 \   -.   /    \     /   .-
                .   .
```

The orbs must be pressed in the right order. Pressing the wrong one
resets it but the player who presses the orb, gets thrown back from the
wall by 10 feet, taking 1d4 damage.

### Grand corridor

> There's grand corridor carved out of the stone. Torches of a similar
> design from Elidyr's tower adorn the walls, fire flickering out of
> them. The corridor is about 200ft long and about 10ft wide. You can
> see 3 corridors off the left hand wall and 2 off the right hand wall —
> these are built at odd intervals. The space in here is almost
> pristine, apart from dust. The grand doors that are at the end of the
> corridor are open.

The smaller corridors as the characters go along:

1.  a corridor on the right, it's about 70ft long.
2.  a corridor on the left, it's about 90ft long.
3.  a short corridor on the right, and then a door
4.  a short corridor on the left, and then a door
5.  a short corridor on the right, and then a door

### Tomb of King Lunit Rehani

> Coming through the main doors, an expansive vaulted room is before
> you. It's about 120ft long. In the centre of the room a large
> sarcophagus is built onto a stone platform with steps running up to
> it. A blue crystalline stone outcrop is right above the sarcophagus,
> casting weird flickering light from the torches around the room.
>
> Between the centre and each corner are 4 pillars. Each of these 4
> pillars intertwine to build up to the vaulted ceiling.
>
> There is a large engraving on the ground in front of you.
>
> Collapsed at one of the pillars is a slashed and bloodied body wearing
> robes. A backpack lies on the floor before the engraving, its contents
> strewn.

After two minutes in the room, the stone above the centre of the room
flashes a bright blue. Nothing happens for a couple of seconds until the
characters can hear the scraping of stone. The sarcophagus lids are
sliding open. Skeletons begin to climb out. There are 11 skeletons.

The large engraving shows a simple carved map with each of the rooms
labelled; the engravings are in Carnian.

![The engraving showing the rooms labelled in Carnian.](/images/unbound/tomb-engraving.jpg)

The backpack (and the area around the backpack) contains the following
supplies:

- a hammer
- 10 pitons
- 10 torches
- a tinderbox
- 10 days of rations
- a waterskin
- 50ft of hempen rope
- a partially translated copy of the engraving showing the "Lord's
  Tomb", the "Lord's guard tomb", a storage room and "The Tomb of the
  Vanquisher" — the writing seems to have been interrupted.

![A rough partial translation of the engraving.
](/images/unbound/tomb-translated.jpg)

### The Lord's guard room

If the players try to go through this room, 6 skeletons will leave their
sarcophagi to attack the players almost immediately.

### Giant spider's chamber

Door is stiff to open.

Room full of spider webs, some light filters down from a hole in the
ceiling, sarcophagi are closed.

When the players enter, the skeletons will try to get out of their
sarcophagi — 3 successfully will do so, the characters can hear the
other skeletons scraping to get out.

After about 18 seconds, a giant spider will come to investigate.

The spider and skeletons may attack each other.

### Tomb of the Vanquisher

Raised sarcophagus in the middle of the room. Arch across the middle of
the room. Can see some more sarcophagi past the arch.

Players will feel a sense of uneasy sadness and unfulfillment as they
walk into the room. The room feels a lot colder as well.

The players will recognise the text as the same that's on the stone
engraving, and now on their map:

> Faurin, Vanquisher of Elidyr

If the players open the sarcophagus, they will find a skeleton with an
amulet. If they take the amulet, the door will slam shut. A pale white
figure will appear between the door and the players.

> ‘That amulet must stay here,’ it says sorrowfully. ‘I cannot
> let you leave with it or knowledge of it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.’

After saying that to the players, it will start to move towards them
with its sword out. If the players attack, the skeletons will join
Faurin, although the ghost will step out of the fight at the start.

The ghost, gone mad with time, is only focussed on preventing it from
ever getting to Elidyr and it will be very difficult to reason with it.
If the players mention being sent or who they were sent by, the ghost
will become violent and impossible to deal with.

The ghost will not be convinced to let the players leave with the amulet
and it can only be taken by force.

### _STORAGE_

Room large enough to have a short rest in. Has a chest containing mostly
rotted/decayed belongings that have turned to dust. There's 50gp and 2
gems each worth 50gp each.

The door can be shut and barred if the players wish to rest.

### Locked door

This locked door requires a DC 22 Dexterity check to unlock it.

### Collapsed passageway

The corridor has completely collapsed, rubble blocking it entirely.

### Hidden doorway

A successful Perception (Wisdom) check of 20 DC will uncover a door.

### \* Additional Tombs

Each contains 3 skeletons that will attack the players almost
immediately. In each of the tombs, the players will find 3d10 gold.

## The Letter and Tavern in Jairnt

### The Letter

<blockquote class="letter">

Meet at the Watcher's Tavern in Jairnt, North of Renaura, on the night
of the next new moon. There's a matter to discuss that affects many
people's lives. I can provide you with a significant reward if you
agree to help. Please be discrete.

Bring Elmon and Meriele.

</blockquote>

> You've heard news and rumours or a recent deposition of King Morcant,
> the old leader of the City of Renaura.

### Outside the tavern

> After a few days of travel, braving the bleak and cold, you've finally
> reached the Watcher's Tavern in the small village of Jairnt, in the
> foothills of the Renau Mountains.
>
> The tavern leans against its neighbours, the tiled roof sagging. Warm
> light spills out of the windows and boisterous chatter emanates,
> inviting you in from the quiet cold and dark. You can smell wood smoke
> and charred meat.

### Inside the tavern

> The moment you open the door, warm air floods out. The must of tobacco
> smoke and spices fill the room, combining with the smoke and charred
> meat. The many merry patrons chatting loudly amongst themselves hardly
> look over, though one shouts, "Get in! Quickly! You're letting the
> warmth out." A few people keep to the corners, alone and cloaked
> but little attention is paid to them.
>
> The bar has a few people being served at the bar by a young teen boy.

The people in the bar won't know about the petitioner if the characters
ask.

The bar serves cheap wine, reasonable ale, and cider. Some spiced meats
can be served as well.

### The petitioner

> After a few minutes in the tavern, a tall hooded figure wearing a worn
> traveller's cloak approaches from one of the corners. The figure takes
> a chair from a neighbouring table, and places it at yours, immediately
> sitting. The figure, in a graceful voice, says, "Good evening, Prince
> Aseir, Elmon, and Meriele. I'm glad to see that you've answered my
> request to discuss a matter with you."
>
> From the voice, you can tell that this person is unmistakably a woman

The woman's petition to the character's:

> The city's previous leader, King Morcant, has been supplanted by Lord
> Telnetar. Telnetar was once the leader of one of the three great noble
> houses in Renaura. The two remaining major noble houses in Renaura
> have stayed quiet and kept to their own business.
>
> It's odd, because Telnetar, when he was a noble was good-hearted and
> sociable. Now, he rarely leaves the castle and gives tyrannical and
> harsh orders to quash any opposition to his rule. The people of the
> city are living and acting out of fear.
>
> My request of you, adventurers, is that you find out what Telnetar is
> doing and put a stop to it. You must stick together and be discrete or
> I think it is likely that you will be doomed to fail.

The petitioner is Juvia, the daughter of King Morcant, well versed in
the politics of the city, poised to be the next Lord of the city. She
fled with her father during Telnetar's violent coup, after they saw the
power in their assailants.

She is a 5th-level School of Evocation Wizard. Her intelligence score is
17, intelligence modifier +3, spell save DC 14, spell attack modifier
+6.

The sort of information this person knows:

- the locations of the nobles' mansions.
- information about the current nobles and which ones are most likely
  to help the characters.
- the direction to the city.
- _reluctant_: her own identity, she fears that, if the characters find
  out who she is, her family may be persecuted. She will explain to the
  characters that she's worried about the knowledge causing harm to
  others if pressed for an answer.
- _reluctant_: the location of her father, King Morcant, and the rest
  of his family.
- _reluctant_: how she knows the characters, she met them when they
  visited the city and was awed by Prince Aseir's stories.

The characters can identifier her if they succeed on a DC 16
Investigation check, if they have previously met King Morcant in his
castle for a banquet. If the characters verbally identify her in a way
that's heard, they will be assaulted on the way to Renaura by five
bandits who demand more information from the characters.

She will give them 100gp each for the troubles so far.

## City of Renaura

### Journey to Renaura

> You're following the road south towards the city, through the forest
> in the foothills of the mountain. The ground is icy and a thin layer
> of snow covers the road. Most of the trees are bare.

> The forest clears after a few miles, showing the bare foothills
> surrounding the City of Renaura which is a few miles away. Though most
> of the city is hidden from you by the surrounding valley, you can see
> the familiar sight of the scarred city walls and a few of the taller
> buildings that are in the lower parts of the city. The city gate is
> open but only a few people are passing in and out of it. Smoke rises
> from some of the chimneys of the homesteads but their farms are quiet.
> A few look to be entirely abandoned.

### Approaching the city

There are eight guards at gate, two on each side, four standing in a
line across the middle. When the characters reach the gate, the guard
closest to the middle on the right will ask the characters to halt and
as what their intentions in the city are.

If the guards think the characters are suspicious, they will let them in
the city but report them to Qa'lir.

### The main street

> Where the main street was previously busy and full of life, only a few
> stalls remain staffed. Sitting in the alleyways and streets are
> beggars.

### The beggar outside the Dragon's Claw

The beggar, as the characters pass the Dragon's Claw, will say "If you
Elmon, a little help for an old friend." It will require a DC 18
Intelligence (Investigation) roll for him to recognise it's the
librarian from the castle. In any case, in exchange for food and drink,
he will promise the characters some information if they will speak in a
private place. If the characters ignore the beggar, he will seek them if
they enter the Dragon's Claw, claiming to the barman that he's returning
an item to the characters that they dropped outside.

In the private place, he will help the will give the characters some
information about the deposition of the old King Morcant where the Lord
and his daughter escaped.

### The Dragon's Claw

The mood in the dragons claw is a lot less friendly than the last time.

The barkeep will be happy to serve them. He will try very hard to sell
them on accommodation for the night that would normally be considered
comfortable.

The characters may hear about a recent announcement that a clerk from
the Temple of Ilmater is going to be executed in the morning of the next
day.

### The Temple of Ilmater

A few guards will be in the Temple of Ilmater, arguing with a senior
priest that the characters will recognise as Wurcon.

> "She is a member of the Ilmateri, you have no right to arrest her as
> no other Lord has before," shouts Wurcon.
>
> "Do not blame us for her arrest old man," one of the guards says, "the
> order came direct from Lord Telnetar and it was his own guards that
> captured her. We are only under orders to prepare for her execution."
>
> As Wurcon steps forward angrily, "You must-." The silent guard pushes
> him to the ground and says, "Do not threaten us, there is nothing we
> can do."

Wuron, if helped by the characters, will take the characters to a side
room to explain the recent events regarding their clerk, Glanna. He will
know that Glanna left, saying that she had some temple business at the
Telnetar mansion, though he now thinks that she was up to something.

### Farnit's mansion

If the characters go to Farnit's mansion, they will be informed by
servants that their master is not around. The servant will know where
Farnit is but is reluctant to reveal that information.

### Pertana's mansion

If the characters go to Pertana's mansion, they will find both Farnit
and Pertana "discussing business" in the study. The servants will be
reluctant to let them see the nobles.

The rooms in the mansion are well decorated and it's clear that Pertana
is rich.

Farnit and Pertana will be shocked to be interrupted, will try to hide
all of the documents that they have out, draw weapons and will berate
their servants for interrupting them. They won't attack straight away
but Pertana will begrudgingly ask the players, "What business is so
important that you must interrupt our private meeting?"

> The study is large with books and parchment on large book cases on the
> wall. Wood panelling surrounds the room and it is ornately decorated.
> A fire crackles in the large fireplace.
>
> A portly middle-aged gentleman is looking over parchment and books at
> the desk. An woman is seated, reading out a passage from a book
> intently, "... and the Vanquisher, Faurin, took his own life..."
>
> Hearing you enter the woman throws the book to the ground and quickly
> draws a short sword. The man throws his cloak over the contents of the
> table. The woman shouts, "What is the meaning of this interruption!
> Servants! You were ordered to prevent anybody from entering my study."

If Farnit and Pertana think that the players might be useful or
friendly, given their notoriety, Pertana will give them the following
information:

> "I only impart this knowledge because we, the Watchers, are desperate.
> We are not generals or warriors, just traders and scholars from a
> prosperous city. We have not fought in hundreds of years and we
> wouldn't even know where to start. Many are calling Farnit and I
> apathetic towards the circumstances we face.
>
> "We are not, however, apathetic. We are fighting in our own way.
> Mostly we gather information hoping to find some way of ending the
> tyranny of Telnetar. While we have not found anything that Farnit and
> I can do, I now think there is something the three of you can do.
>
> "The day after Telnetar attacked the castle, a guarded carriage went
> from the castle to his mansion in the dead of night. The guards went
> into his mansion and fighting could be heard there. We saw the guards
> dragging some people out, into the carriages. The carriage didn't go
> back to the castle but instead to one of Telnetar's warehouses.
>
> "The day before last, Glanna (who I think you have met before)
> insisted that the best thing to do was to find out what happened in
> the mansion, as clearly something notable happened that night.
> However, she's not returned and we have heard news that she will be
> executed.
>
> "I fear that we, Farnit and I, have been revealed and that we will
> soon be.
>
> "I implore you to help us find out what happened here. I think it
> might be key to saving this city. Do whatever you think is best here,
> whether that is investigating the mansion, saving Glanna, or investing
> the warehouse."

### Telnetar's mansion

There's a small guard presence outside the front gates of the mansion,
preventing easy access, these guards are under order from the new Lord
to prevent civilians from entering the Lord's mansion, though they don't
know what's inside. The guards will react to loud noises inside the
manor, worrying that they've failed at their job.

Iron fences, 10ft high, with hedges behind them surround the Lord
Telnetar's mansion grounds. The fences are in good condition but the
hedges are.

A few servants lucky to survive have barricaded themselves in the
noble's chambers. This chamber contains the key required to open the
secret entrance to the castle.

#### The grand entrance hall

> What was once clearly a great entrance hall is ruined. Dust, debris
> and dried blood cover most of the surfaces.
>
> A grand staircase is straight ahead, though the top half of it has
> collapsed entirely, revealing a stony dark corridor behind a
> disintegrating wall. Large chunks of the marble banister have fallen
> into the staircase. A large archway opens from the top of the stairs
> to the fist floor but the floor has collapsed where the staircase
> would have ended. Through an arch at the end of the stairs allows you
> to see into a large light room.
>
> A mangled, rotting body is slumped against the far left wall, a
> sword abandoned in its chest. Its stench filling the room.
>
> To both the left and the right of the main door are ornate arches.
> Through the left you can see shattered lounge furniture and through
> the right a gallery, though the artwork lies scattered and torn on the
> floor.
>
> On either side of these arches are collapsed suits of armour, apart
> from to the left off the left door.
>
> From the dark corridor you hear the echoing a woman cry out in pain
> and a deep raspy laugh.

If the characters approach either of the doors, the armour guarding that
door will become animated. These are _Animated Armor_ (see page 19 of
the Monster Manual).

If the characters approach the rotting body, the sword in the body will
become animated. This is a _Flying Sword_ (see page 20 of the Monster
Manual).

If the characters attempt to climb over the rubble, they will need to
make a DC 13 Dexterity check or otherwise fall down the rubble and down
the stairs.

#### The drawing room

The drawing room has shattered furniture all around. Signs of fighting
are here as well. The door to the dining room is ajar and the characters
can smell rotting food from there.

There is a secret door, leading to the servants' passage, disguised as a
wall on the right wall of the room.

#### The dining room

The stench of rotting food fills this room, the long dining table is on
its side, food all over the floor.

There are two secret doors, both leading to the servants' passage,
disguised as the wall, one on the right side of the room, one on the far
side of the room. The secret door at the far side of the room is ajar.

#### The gallery

> The paintings are torn, frames shattered; the statues broken. At the
> end of the room, there's a barred door which has a couple of broken
> statues barring it shut. Behind the doors you can hear some scratching
> and shuffling.

The barred doors lead to the library.

There is a secret door, leading to the servants' passage, disguised as a
wall on the left side of this room.

#### The library

> This room, like the others lies in ruin. It was once a library, the
> book cases are shattered and the books are on the floor.

There are eight zombies in here, they are all wearing servant's
clothing.

There are two secret doors, both leading the servants' passage,
disguised as the wall, one on the left side of the room, one on the far
side of the room.

#### The servants' passage

> A narrow stone passage.

Where the collapsed wall and stairs are from the mansion's entrance
hall, there are stairs leading downwards; however, the top step is if
you come at the stairs from the other direction.

The passage at the end has a spiral staircase up and three ordinary
doors leading to the servants' quarters. At the top of the spiral
staircase, there is immediately a wooden door. From behind it, shuffling
noises can be heard.

There are plain doors that match up to the secret doors in the drawing
room, the dining room, the gallery, and the library.

#### The servants' quarters

> The beds in this room are scattered, all of the bedding has shredded.
> There's no sign of any movement at all.

#### The kitchen

> The stench of rotting food also fills this room. The preparation
> tables are full of half-prepared food. A large cauldron has been
> knocked over at the far end of the room under a chimney. Ashes cover
> the floor. Pots and pans are scattered everywhere.
>
> There's no sign of any movement in this room.

#### The storeroom

> A room full of barrels but most of the barrels are empty apart from
> some stale bread and a few mouldy apples.

#### The grand corridor

> A long corridor, wider and ornately decorated. At the far end is a
> large window. To the left are three doors, the middle and larger one
> is closed. The others are open. To the right is a large open archway.
>
> In the corridor, four zombies wearing servant's clothing.

From the spiral staircase, the doors on the left hand side (closest to
furthers) lead to the study, master's bedroom, and dressing room.

The door to the master's bedroom won't open if the players try to push
it open. When the players do this, a man's voice from inside will shout
"Wake up! They're trying to get in again!"

The door will take a DC 14 Strength check to open it.

#### The ballroom

> A large ballroom with a large wooden ceiling. On each of the walls are
> two large windows. The broken staircase is at the other end of the
> room.
>
> In the room are another ten zombies wearing servant's clothing.

#### The study

The study is another room full of destruction. The desk is smashed and
there is paper everywhere.

#### The dressing room

The dressing room is another room full of destruction. There is rich
clothes of both lords and ladies scattered around the floor.

#### The master bedroom

> This room, slightly larger than the rooms downstairs, also has ruined
> furniture. A broken four poster bed and chest of drawers are piled
> directly in front of you, moved out of the way to let you through the
> door.
>
> A pile of food is against the left wall, in far left corner is a pile
> of bedding.
>
> To the right of the room there's a large closed chest.
>
> There are four servants and a boy looking tired and bedraggled, their
> clothing torn and soiled: two of the servants are closer to you,
> having moved the furniture; one is sitting on the bedding with the
> boy, the other is standing in guard of the chest.

The four servants in here managed to hide during the fight and then hid
in this room. They hid under the food in the barrels, one of them hid
the chest with them when they saw what was happening.

In the chest is:

- a carved ivory statuette
- a silver and gold broach
- a ceremonial electrum dagger with a black pearl in the pomel
- a lute (Doss Lute)
- a dagger (a Dagger of Venom)
- a small carved wooden box with an inscription on it

On the small carved wooden box, the inscription says:

<blockquote class="letter">

In your oath to me, you have bent your knee. Remember this oath, when
using this key.

</blockquote>

Inside the box is a small orb wrapped in fabric which has an inked map
which shows the castle and its walls and marks a small passage in the
cliff outside the castle walls to the south.

#### The cellar

> The cellar is dim, lit only by a couple of torches.
>
> At the end of the room are are iron barred prison door, both are open.
> To the left of the room is a table.
>
> In the centre of the right of the room is a bound woman and gagged
> woman, she's sobbing. Standing above her is a man ready to strike her.
> His skin is very pale ashy taut skin, he wears dark scaly armour.
>
> At the table are two hooded figures.

The man standing next to her is a wight, the two hooded figures are cult
fanatics.

### Telnetar's warehouse

This is where Telnetar's family is being held captive.

When alley for the entrance of the warehouse is trapped. If the players
trip the wire, they will cause a loud crashing sound that will alert the
guards inside. The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches
between the two walls. A DC to spot the wire is 10. A successful DC 15
Dexterity check using thieves' tools will successfully disable the trap.
Trying without thieves' tools will require a check with a disadvantage.
On a failed check the trap triggers.

There are no guards standing outside the warehouse.

#### Entry room

This small room has some tools for moving boxes and barrels and a small
table with a couple of chairs.

If the trap wasn't triggered, two cultists will be in this room, sitting
at a table. If the players make enough noise, the warehouse defenders in
the first store room will join the fight.

If the trap was triggered, there will be the two cultists plus the
warehouse defenders in the first store room.

There's a door on the opposite side of the room which is barred and
locked (DC 17 strength to unlock it). There's a door to the right that
is open if the characters triggered the trap and closed otherwise. If
the characters make a lot of noise during the fight and the trap hasn't
been triggered then

#### Store room: 1

This room has various luxury wares, it has a door that leads back to the
entry room and another locked door to the left.

This room has two cultists in it and a cultist fanatic. The cultist
fanatic has keys to the prisoners' room (the same key fits both doors).

#### Store room: 2

This store room is filled with large boxes, chests and barrels. There
are five cult fanatics waiting to ambush the players.

#### Prisoners' room

Most of the items have been taken out of this room. There's a table with
a couple of chairs.

In this room there's a cult fanatic who is guarding the prisoners.

The prisoners are a woman and two girls who are all sitting in one of
the corners of the room.

### The public execution of Glanna in the city square

This will occur on the morning of the second day that the characters are
in the city, if the characters haven't saved Glanna.

Her last words will be "From the scripture of Ilmater, 'go to the
Swift's old nest to find the way to the new nest.'"

## Qa'lir's interference

When Qa'lir becomes aware of the characters, she will try to interfere
with them.

### Thugs

If Qa'lir becomes aware of the characters in the city, she will send
eight thugs to threaten them.

The thugs will threaten the characters if they find themselves somewhere
more secluded in the city. The thugs will attack the characters if
provoked.

> We think it's time you took your business outside the city.

The captain of the thugs will have a letter from the Qa'lir with the
instructions. It will only be signed with a symbol with wings and

### Assassination

If the thugs fail, Qa'lir will send an Invisible Stalker as an assassin.
It will be under instruction to kill the characters in a private place,
probably their room in an inn or even a safe-house. When the characters
enter the

### Guards

If the assassin fails, Qa'lir will send guards to incarcerate the
characters (if their location is known) for _treason_. These guards
will attempt to jail the characters in the

## After success

- Remaining wights under Qa'lir's control will wreak havoc. Most of
  them were stationed with the guards and will have been taken down
- Cultists will flee
- Constructs will continue to fight but will fight the cultists
- Telnetar will leave the castle and city
- Pertana will rule until King Morcant returns
