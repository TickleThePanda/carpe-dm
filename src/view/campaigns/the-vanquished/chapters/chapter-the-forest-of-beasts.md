title: "The Forest of Beasts"
type: "Chapter"
index: 5
---

The people of [Aymeluma] rarely travel into the forest of beasts. Packs
wolves often roam, there have been sightings of owlbears, and there are
tales of a great eight legged beast that roams at night. The elves don't
hunt in the forest as it's difficult to track creatures.

Deep in the Forest of Beasts, Briid, the Wolf Mother, sends her wolves
to drive the elves from Aymeluma. While she believes she is serving
Silvanus, she has been tricked into these actions by a projection of
Elydir.

## Following the wolf trail

> As you travel into the woods, it gets cold and snowy. The warm and
> safe feeling of Aymeluma quickly leaves your body.

The wolf trail is 6 miles long through the forest. The forest is
difficult terrain. A character must succeed on a Wisdom (Survival) DC 15
check to follow the trail. On a success, the characters successfully
follow the trail - for every half an hour of travel, they go half a
mile. On a failure, it takes 1 hour to find the trail again.

Each day that passes, the add 3 to the Wisdom (Survival) DC to follow
the trail.

### Encounters

**Random encounters**. Check for a random encounter after each 30
minutes of travel. An encounter occurs if a result of 15 or higher is
rolled. Don't check if the characters have already had three random
encounters outdoors in the past 12 hours. After each encounter, the
characters must make another survival check to follow the trail.

**Fixed encounters**. The river encounter will be found after the 4th
mile.

### River

The characters can only encounter this once.

> You can hear water rushing ahead of you. A river flows quickly, it's
> 4 feet deep and 15 feet across. The wolf tracks lead into the water.
> To your left, a waterfall crashes down a 20 foot cliff onto rocky
> outcrops. Tall trees and mossy boulders line the waters edge. Slime
> covered stones peek out of the water.

Using the stones, a character who makes a successful DC 13 Dexterity
(Acrobatics) check will successfully cross the river. On a failure, the
character must make a DC 13 Strength save to avoid being dragged over
the waterfall edge.

Wading across the water, a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check.
On a failure, the character is swept away with the current over the
waterfall edge.

A character who is swept away with the current over the waterfall edge
will take 2d6 bludgeoning damage from the fall.

To climb up or down the cliff, a character will need to succeed on a DC
15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a failure, they will fall and take
1d6 bludgeoning damage.

The characters have a disadvantage on the check to follow the wolf
trail.

<aside>

### Briid's eyes

Briid has an affinity to the forest and the animals that. News of people
in the forest will travel to her fast, unless those who travel are
stealthy.

</aside>

### Deer corpse

> An stench fills your lungs, rotten flesh and blood. The trail is
> unclear. The forest is quiet all around you, the trees stand still.

If a character makes a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check, they
will find the source of the smell.

> You find the source of the stench. The partial remains of a deer.

This deer has been killed by wolves and there are lots of tracks all
around. A character who succeeds on a successful DC 10 Intelligence
(Investigation) check will notice that this deer was killed by wolves
and a trail of bloody wolf paw-prints giving an advantage to the next
check to follow the trail.

### Binding roots

> The path descends into a gorge, you can't see the end through the
> trees. You can see the bare roots of trees covering the floor.

The gorge is 100 foot long and covered in roots. Once a character
reaches 50 feet into the gorge, the roots start grasping at the
characters.

If a character succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) they will notice
the roots moving. While in the area, and the roots are grasping, a
character must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw or be
restrained. While restrained, they take 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

Each 5 foot square of roots has an AC of 12 and 4 HP. They have
vulnerability to fire.

Climbing up the walls of the gorge takes a DC 13 acrobatics check to
escape.

### Distant howling

> The forest stirs with a gust of wind. You hear wolf howls in the
> distance.

If the characters are travelling, read the following description:

> The trail is difficult to follow.

If one or more of the characters make a successful DC 14 Wisdom
(Perception) check, they will identify that the wolves are in the east.
If they choose to follow the howling, they get an advantage on the check
to follow the wolf trail.

If the characters try to continue to find the path, they will get a
disadvantage on the check to follow the wolf trail.

### False trail

This encounter occurs only if the characters are travelling, otherwise,
treat the result as no encounter.

> A foot trail cuts across the wolf trail.

Briid left this trail. Following it in either direction leads to a spiked
pit (see "Sample Traps" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

If the characters follow this foot trail and attempt to return to the
wolf trail, they will get a disadvantage on the check to follow the
wolf trail.

### Hidden bundle

This encounter occurs only if the characters are travelling, otherwise,
treat the result as no encounter. If at least one of the characters has
a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or higher, read:

> A corner of leather pack peeks out of the snow.

In the pack is 1d4+1 electrum pieces and a tarnished gold amulet in the
shape of bug.

The trail is clear and the characters don't need to make another
survival check to keep on following it.

### Wolves

If at least one of the characters has a passive Wisdom (Perception)
score of 11 or higher, read:

> Wolves howl nearby, too close for comfort.

If more than one wolf is present, the others are close by. If none
of the characters has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or
higher, the wolves catch the party by surprise.

If a single wolf is remaining, it will attempt to flee towards the
Hollow Oak Tree.

Following its trail will grant an advantage on the next check to follow
the wolf trail.

### Giant spider

If the characters are travelling, read the following:

> Large webs cover between trees. The wolf tracks cut through, under
> the webs.

The webs are connected to the spider's _Web sense_. If the players try
to circumvent the spider's lair, they have a disadvantage on their
next check to follow the wolf trail.

In the lair, there is 1 giant spider and 1d4 spiders. Hungry and waiting
patiently, they will ambush any prey foolish enough to enter. There is a
dead human cocooned and hanging wearing commoner clothes. If searched,
the human has 9 sp in its belongings.

If the characters are resting and at least one of the characters has a
passive Wisdom (Perception) of 13 or more, read:

> You hear clicks and a creak. A giant spider scuttles down the nearby
> tree.

If none of the characters has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 13 or
more, the giant spider catches the party by surprise.

### Bandits

These bandits are hostile, looking to prey on people in the woods. There
are 1d4+3 bandits.

If the characters are travelling, read the following:

> You hear boisterous laughing and the light of a fire in a clearing up
> ahead.

If the characters are resting and at least one of the characters has a
passive Wisdom (Perception) of 11 or more, read:

> You hear a branch snap and see the outline of a crouched figure in
> the underbrush.

The other bandits will be close by.

### Owlbear

If at least one of the characters has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of
11 or more, read:

> There are deep scratches in the bark of the trees. Bushes have been
> trampled.

If the characters are moving quietly and not carrying light sources,
they can try to hide.

The owlbear is hungry. If it loses more than half of its hit points, it
flees into the forest.

The characters have a disadvantage on the next check for following the
wolf trail.

## Hollow Oak Tree

![Map of the dungeon](/images/the-forest-of-beasts/map.png)

### Outside

> The path slopes down into a crater. In the the centre is a giant
> oak tree. Its branches are bare and leaves cover the ground. Small
> pools steam around the crater. An organic passageway flows into the
> tree.
>
> A pack of five wolves lies outside the passageway, sheltering under
> the tree's branches, one stands watching around.

The tree is over 100ft wide and 250ft tall

The wolves are guarding the entrance and will attack to ward off
intruders. Any character that tries to sneak past must make a DC 18
check on a if approached and will protect the entrance.

### 1. Entrance

If the characters have attacked the wolves outside, characters hear the
a woman pleading to help from a projected image of Elydir posing as a
servant of Silvanus, who abandons her. Read the following description:

> A thick pillar of smooth wood grows in the middle of the room. Animal
> furs cover the walls and rickety wooden furniture leans against the
> natural wooden walls. Carved bowls overflow with fresh nuts and
> berries. Scattered candles cast a dim light. Incense smoke fills your
> lungs.
>
> To your left, hanging furs hang as a doorway. From here, you can hear
> two women arguing.
>
> "They're here, they're here," one cries. "They're going to kill us.
> Please protect me."
>
> "You served your purpose. Go now and die in what way seems best to
> you," a cold voice says.
>
> It grows quiet, apart from sobbing.

### 2. Druid living area

Read the following description when the characters enter:

> A small bed covered in animal furs leans against the wall. In the
> centre of the room is 15 foot diameter chalk circle; at the centre of
> the circle, more furs.
>
> A woman wrapped in animal furs sobs. She stands in the way of two
> wolves.

Briid is a human **Druid**. She carries a gold amulet in the shape of an
oak leaf (5gp) as her spellcasting focus and a gem worth 10gp on her
person.

When she casts **entangle** oak roots and branches sprout from the tree
instead of grasping weeds and vines.

#### Roleplaying Briid the Wolf Mother

Briid, a thin young woman with blonde hair, has absolute faith in her
purpose to serve Silvanus to reclaim the hot springs and Aymeluma back
for him. However, it has not been a servant of Silvanus appearing to her
but Elydir. Briid cares about her wolf pack over everything else. Her
attacks on Aymeluma have come at little cost.

She will not attack the characters first, if she is cornered with her
wolves. She will plead with party to let her wolves free as she doesn't
want them harmed and will offer to have the players take her life in
exchange for the wolves. She will explain that, without her leading
them, they will avoid the village.

However, if she learns of the party's approach and they have been
travelling for a few days, Briid will bring the fight to them.

Whether or not the party let the wolves go, Briid will want revenge them
through their deaths. While she may have agreed to allow the characters
to take her life, she won't give it willingly.

### 3. Store

> Small pots and barrels cover tottering shelves. These are filled with
> various potion ingredients, nuts, dried berries, and dried fruit. A
> small chest sits in the middle of the room.

The chest contains 4 gp, 3 sp, and 35 cp, a potion of healing, and a
10gp gem. There's enough dried food for 10 rations.
