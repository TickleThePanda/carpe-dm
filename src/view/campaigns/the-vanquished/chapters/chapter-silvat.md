A path connects Aymeluma and the settlement, through the forest of the beasts.
However, the entrance to the druid settlement is hidden in location by a maze
designed so that only those connected to nature can reach through it.

### Silvatan lore

The Silvatans know the following:

- Briid was exiled by Yorhorn instead of killed as an act of mercy after she
  tried to kill Yorhorn.
- The Silvatans sing of the shared warmth between the villages of Aymeluma and
  Silvat and an ancient agreement.
- Briid wanted the Silvanus druids to attack Aymeluma but most disagreed because
  of the good relations.
- Briid said she was seeing an avatar of Silvanus. But it was only cold dread
  that the villages could feel.
- THe Silvatans occasionally trade with Aymeluma for gold.

### Path

The path to the Druid settlement is 2 miles long. Check for a random encounter
after each 30 minutes of travel. An encounter occurs if a result of 15 or higher
is rolled. Don't check if the characters have already had three random
encounters outdoors in the past 12 hours.

> A narrow path goes to the north west. While the path is easy to follow, vines
> and roots make this path difficult to walk.

### Druid maze

Read the following description when

> Ahead of you, the trees and undergrowth grow intertwined to form a 5ft wide
> tunnel, tall enough to walk into. The walls of the tunnel are thick.
>
> Before the entrance of the maze is a carved wooden sign.
>
> > Without the secret of heart,\
> > Far you will walk and wander,\
> > But danger in times' squander,\
> > And you cannot dream to part.

#### Exiting the maze

Each tile has three exits, the wolf (**W**) exit, the owl (**O**) exit, and the
bear (**B**) exit. Each time the characters arrive leave through an exit, add a
new tile to the maze, connecting the **E** of the new tile to the exit the
characters left through. To exit the maze, they must exit a tile first by the
owl, the next tile by the bear, and the final tile by the wolf.

When the characters first reach the **Wolf** statue, read the description:

> In the tunnel, a wooden statue of a wolf, mid step, stares out further into
> the maze.

When the characters first reach the **Owl** statue, read the description:

> In the tunnel, a wooden statue of an owl, wings stretched in mid flight,
> stares out further into the maze.

When the characters first reach the **Bear** statue, read the description:

> In the tunnel, a wooden statue of a small bear, mid step, stares out further
> into the maze.

If the characters try to break out through the walls, read the description:

> As you damage the walls, vines and branches regrow quickly to fill the area.

#### Centre room

At the centre of each tile, **I** is a room with the following text:

> Four large trees grow tall in each corner of the room, their canopy like a
> vaulted ceiling. Light trickles through, illuminating a wooden podium into
> which words are carved.
>
> > At first my beak is sharp,\
> > Then honey stops the hunger's smart,\
> > Until at last I howl to the moon,\
> > Follow me and we will part.

For each tile the party has successfully travelled through, the associated text
for the exit for that tile will have disappeared from the riddle room.

#### The awakened tree

Defending the maze is an awakened tree. This trees can move through the walls of
the maze. Each time the characters move within range, the tree will attack once
and then disappear through the walls of the maze. To determine the location of
the tree, roll two d10s. The first is the horizontal location of the tree
left-to-right, and the second is vertical location top-to-bottom. If the tree is
in the path, it will be indistinguishable from a wall and block the path, if
it's in the wall, it will be indistinguishable from the wall its in. Determine
the tree's location whenever the characters move to a new tile or after the tree
moves.

### Druid settlement

Once the characters have exited the maze, read the following:

> Tall pine trees circle three wooden buildings, each shaped like the shell of
> an acorn. The closest is larger than the others and its door faces the maze
> exit. You smell the smoke which drifts out of the top of each. Around the
> buildings, six oak leaf shaped pools steam making . You can see a few elves,
> half-elves, and humans working in the area around it.

Each building is very similar.

> A large fire provides a little more warmth for the building. Druids, wrapped
> in thick furs, work. Most are working while around the fire. A chatter fills
> the air, like the smoke from the fire. You can hear a working song about a
> seed of warmth that flows

In the larger building:

> A half-elf man and an elf woman stand chatting. The man stands tall, a golden
> crown in the shape of twigs and branches on his head and wears well maintained
> fur robes.

The man is Yorhorn and the woman is Endi.

#### Roleplaying the Silvatans

**Yorhorn** (NG half-elf man) is an intimidating man who stands tall, and speaks
rarely and softly. He is protective of Silvat and his inhabitants. He is too
trusting, showing too much compassion and mercy to those who oppose him. In
addition to the information that the Silvatans know, Yorhorn met an elf woman
from Aymeluma who traded a gold leaf for some magic. Yorhorn gave the gold leaf
to Briid, who was a child at the time. He can't remember what the trader looked
like, other than she was an older woman who wore a purple cloak with gold
embroidery.

**Endi** (NG half-elf woman) is very popular and always has a sympathetic ear.
She believes it is important to achieve your goals and protect Silvat. She
believes cleanliness is a waste of time - it'll just get dirty again. She
encouraged Yorhorn to banish Briid.

**Axilya** (CN elf woman) wearing simple, practical clothes, and a well-worn
travelling cloak. She is a socially awkward. She believes it is important to
connect with nature and take everything in moderation. She believes excelling at
a skill isn't all it's cracked up to be. Axilya knows of the location of the
Wellsprings of Vitality. She will agree to take the characters to the
Wellsprings in return for some ammo for hunting.
