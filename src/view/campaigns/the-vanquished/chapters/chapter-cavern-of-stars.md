## Cavern of Stars

A tranquil monastery built into the mountain, into a cave of luminescent
gems. Many of those, who still the many who mourn their lives or losses
travel here to meditate in peace. Only those given permission by a
Planetar, Mydaiel, can enter into the Cavern of Stars.

It is staffed by Hound Archon's, who act as caretakers, guards, and
administrators of the monastery. There are two guards, three caretakers,
and one administrator.

Silence is expected in the Cavern of Stars, though telepathic
communication and non-verbal communication is allowed. The patients are
likely to report anybody unexpected to the Hound Archons, though this
won't be taken seriously immediately because of how unexpected and
unlikely it is.

Any visitors who break these rules will be asked to leave by the Hound
Archons, though only the guards will show force, and even that will only
be in the most dire of situations. The Hound Archons will alert
superiors if anybody breaking the rules appears.

The inside of the Cavern of Stars is _Hallowed_. Celestials are excluded
from the normal effects. In addition, bright light fills the area.
Magical darkness created by spells of a lower than level 8 can't
extinguish the light.

#### Cavern of Stars Interior

In the deeper interior, the corridors and rooms have the following
description

> The walls and floors are the same material as the outer cave but are
> polished instead. Carvings with markings filled with gold, and painted
> murals cover the walls depicting peaceful vistas and godly figures.
> Occasionally, there is a statue of an angel or other angelic being.

### The Grand Doorway

> The path is steep up the mountain. To your right, a steep valley with
> a river flowing through it; the river flows from out of a cave below -
> a light shining out of it.
>
> At the end of the path, large marble doors are built into the cliff.
> Two angelic statues stand beside the door, holding their swords over
> the doorway. A large garden is built around the doorway and statues,
> filled with small water features, benches and chairs.
>
> Just in front of the marble doors, a single Hound Archon is standing
> guard.

A main door is guarded by a Hound Archon, Drammer. He is under orders to
guard the entrance and to allow pre-agreed people into the monastery.
These must be checked with the monastery administrator on their arrival.
He is a loyal guard and follows these orders without question or
hesitation, though perhaps a little too the letter.

Morcanloth may be "resting" in the gardens in a new disguise, if he
reaches the Cavern of Stars before them.

> Behind the large doors, you can see a corridor. Bright light, as if it
> was a bright summer's day, shines out from inside. Deeper inside, it
> glistens.

This doorway leads to the [Balcony of Joy](#balcony-of-joy).

### Balcony of Joy

> You walk into a marble entrance hall and out onto a huge white stone
> balcony that overlooks an immense cavern. The cavern's surface is
> covered in sparkling stones and iridescent gems. Millions of pinpricks
> of light shine upon you from the walls - though you can't see a light
> source. The cavern is roughly circular, about 100ft across in all
> directions, except to the east where it opens out through a natural
> arch.
>
> Straight ahead, to the north, a huge natural pillar, shining like
> everything else, rises from the bottom of the cavern. Around the
> pillar is a marble platform - another garden, somebody tending to it.
> A bridge crosses from the balcony you're on across to the central
> platform.
>
> Across to the north-east there's a smaller balcony, tables and chairs
> are laid out. This balcony is separate with no visible pathways to it.
>
> To your left, the balcony narrows to a path around the edge of the
> cave, reaching a door on the far-west side of the cavern. Another
> bridge spans from this door across to the central pillar.
>
> To your right, a marble stairway follows around the edge of the
> cavern, downwards. In the area 50ft below the balcony, a few people
> are sparring with wooden swords, spears, and staffs. To the east,
> below the huge archway, is a large silvery lake, a river flows from
> this out of the cavern, below you, to the south, a bridge crosses it.
>
> Immediately to your left, in the entrance hall, is a marble doorway.
>
> The only sound you here is the water flowing and the wood weapons
> hitting each other.

If the players are in sight of the door across the other side of the
cavern:

> Hidden behind the central pillar, you can now see an additional bridge
> across to another door on the far North side.

There are four entrances and exits:

- the door to the west leads to the [West Residency
  Entrance](#west-residency-entrance).
- the door to the north leads to the [North Residency
  Entrance](#north-residency-entrance).
- the stairway down to the right leads to [Lower Cavern
  East](#lower-cave-east).
- the door immediately on the left leads to the [Administrator's
  Room](#administrators-room).

### Administrator's Room

> Orderly scrolls and books line the shelves of marble room. Sitting at
> a desk is a Hound Archon, deep in its work.

A Hound Archon, Brammer, is the administrator of the Cavern of Stars.

If he meets the characters, he will ask who they are and will check to
see if they are allowed in. If not, he try to escort them out.

### Cavern Pillar

> Around the central pillar, is a beautiful garden. Trees flourish, the
> beds are full of strange and wonderful flowers, huge ivies drape over
> the edge. A dwarf, dressed in white, tends the gardens in silence.
> A Hound Archon dressed in robes stands with them.

The dwarf is Anden Barrelback

### River From a Cavern

A wide river runs out of the cave, the water runs quickly. Walking
through the water directly will take a DC17 strength check. Hanging on
