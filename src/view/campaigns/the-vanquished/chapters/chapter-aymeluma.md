title: "Aymeluma"
type: "Chapter"
index: 4
---

Nestled within a valley, the famed hot springs of Aymeluman give life a chance
to flourish, or at least to give respite from the harsh mountainous lands of
Denau. In the ancient elvish village of Aymeluma, people live simple lives. Good
soils and warm air gift the elves with prosperous farming and many Aymelumans
sing to Chauntea for this blessing.

Over the recent months, life hasn't been as easy as this for the Aymelumans.
There have been wolf attacks from the Forest of Beasts to the North East and the
springs have been running cold. Lady Alymir Glynlamin, like her ancestors before
her, leads Aymeluma, but the village doesn't have the power to defend itself.
She hopes her call for help to neighbouring villages and other lands will bring
safety back to her village.

Only the Council of Elders know the terrible secret of Elydir's heritage, that
she was one of them and they will take this secret to the grave. The oldest of
the elves swore to never let this happen again. When each elf reaches the age of
13, they make a vow never to use magic. Born after the reign of Elydir,
Glynlamin is unaware of her relation to the village.

## Aymeluman lore

In addition to the information known to all Denians, Aymelumans know the
following lore:

- The villagers are ashamed of their natural magical powers. When they reach the
  age of 13, each of them makes a vow never to use them.
- Attacks are usually rare from the Forest of Beasts but recently there's been
  wolf attacks. It's dangerous to go hunting in the Forest of Beasts, especially
  at night, and it is difficult to track things in there. The villagers will
  avoid doing so.
- Lady Glynlamin has been missing during the wolf attacks and, after the attacks
  she appears to be ill.
- The springs are running cold. The village's prayers to Chauntea have failed.
- Some Aymelumans believe that the village has been cursed.
- Relations with the followers of Silvanus, at Silvat, are good - the Silvatans
  occasionally trade with them and there's been no history of conflict. They
  live to north west of Aymeluma a path.

## Areas of the village

![Map of Aymeluma](/images/aymeluma-map.svg)

### Village square

When the characters first enter the village square, read the following
description:

> Marble buildings surround the village square. Two grand buildings, one to the
> east and the west stand taller than the others.
>
> In the centre of the village square is a statue of woman sewing seeds. In
> front of it, five elves sing in beautiful harmony, offering fresh fruit and
> dried to the statue.
>
> Through the square, you can hear the river Ayme rush under a small marble
> bridge, adding to the harmony of the elves.

#### Market

The market runs on every seventh day of each tenday. Available at the market
are: a baker, fresh goods, dried goods, a fletcher, a clothier, a blacksmith,
and a carpenter. The fresh goods are limited due to the springs running cold.
The craftspeople will have a small number of common goods and will accept
commissions for twice the price.

### Glynlamin residence

<figure>

![Glynlamin residence floor 2](/images/glynlamin-residence-floor-2.png)

<figcaption>First floor</figcaption>
</figure>

When the characters first arrive at the building, read the following
description:

> This building, to the east of the square, is clean polished marble which looks
> more grown than built. The walls gently curve and there's barely a crack
> between the stones. A small garden has overgrown.

#### 1. Entrance hall

> The grand entrance hall's stairs are fashioned after oak trees. The stairs to
> climb up opposite to the entrance, to the east, and split off back to a
> balcony above. Before the stairs split, a grand tapestry showing a woman
> sowing seeds, trees around them, and the sun rising behind. Scattered on the
> floor are leaves and other debris.

The stairs lead to area 12.

If a character succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check, they will notice a
darker patch on the tapestry. On the back of the main tapestry, there is a
passage, scrawled in common. Nobody in the village knows of the origin and Lady
Glynlamin is unaware it is there.

> The liar tricks to be unbound.\
> The lover fights again and fails.\
> The raider strikes at all his kind,\
> The captor flees to mountain trails.\
> The caster pursues an end combined,\
> The fighter tells his ancient tales.

#### 2. South corridor

> Candles, half of which are unlit, dingily light the walls. A dusty but
> otherwise well maintained patterned rug follows the corridor path, including
> the curve in the middle from east to south.

#### 3. Library

The library door is locked when not in use by Lady Aymeluma, which it frequently
is. On a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check, a character can break the door down.
On a DC 12 Dexterity check, a character can unlock the door with thieves tools.

> Books and scrolls line the walls and the shelves are untidy. A window provides
> light to the desk where books are strewn. A few unfinished letters are
> scattered across the desk.

The library contains books about the history of Aymeluma and its relation to
other areas. Content about Elydir was destroyed by the Council of Elders out of
shame. The letters are to other villages with advice on matters, none of which
seems relevant to the _attack in the night_.

If a character succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and spend
an hour researching, they will find out that the relations with the followers of
Silvanus in the Forest of Beasts have always been positive and respectful. They
will also find that, while there are books about the gods in here, the book
about Silvanus is missing. If a character succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence
(Investigation) check, they will realise that there are references to books and
history that is missing from 500 years ago.

#### 4. Parlour

> The warm autumn colours and fabric tapestries that adorn the walls don't stop
> the cold from seeping in. At the far end, a grand fireplace is empty, apart
> from charred remains and ash. Above, a large portrait, with an old elf man,
> wearing robes of Silvanus and a gold leaf, he wears an oak leaf signet ring on
> his hand. On the mantelpiece is an empty decorative bell jar.

The gold leaf in the portrait looks similar to the [golden oak amulet]. A
character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check will notice
that number of engraved veins is the same on both.

#### 5. Drawing room

> The dark room is filled with comfortable padded chairs and benches, and dusty
> tables and cabinets. The curtains are unopened.

There is nothing of interest in this room.

#### 6. North corridor

> The short corridor, with a patterned rug following the curve from east to
> north.

#### 7. Dining room

> A large table fills this dining room and it's covered in dirty plates on a
> stained tablecloth.

There is nothing of interest in this room.

#### 8. Servant corridor

> This corridor is short with no furnishings and is lit by a single candle.

#### 9. Servant room

> On one side of this room is a small clean and tidy bedroom. On the other side,
> a messy storage area with tables and chairs.

Often, Aien can be found hungover in this room.

#### 10. Kitchen

> The kitchen has plates and bowls piled in the sink and flour and dust over the
> surfaces.

If this is in the day after the _attack in the night_, then read the following
description:

> On the floor is a smashed glass and a puddle of wine.

The glass was smashed by Maiele when she was rushing to leave, after Aien
arrived back early.

If a character succeeds on an DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check, they
will notice that there is a streak of wine that points towards the pantry.

#### 11. Pantry

The back door is usually locked. If a character succeeds on a DC 17 Strength
check, they can break down the door. If a character succeeds on a DC 13
Dexterity check, they can unlock the door with thieves tools.

> This pantry is lined with barrels and jars, smelling fresh, though it is a
> little dusty.

If a character succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, they will
notice that there is a patch of dried red wine on the door frame.

#### 12. Balcony

> The balcony looks down onto the stairs inside, and a window looks out to the
> village square. There's a door to the north and to the south.

On the balcony, the door to the south leads to Glynlamin's bedroom. The door to
the north leads to a guest bedroom.

#### 13. Lady Glynlamin's room

> A large bedroom with a grand bed and meditation area. The room is clean.

In the days after the attack on the night, Lady Glynlamin will rest in here. She
will be wearing her oak signet ring. This ring will not match the pattern of the
signet on the wax seal on the fake letter.

#### 14. Guest bedroom

> An empty bedroom, with the bed unmade and curtains closed.

There is nothing of interest in this room.

#### Roleplaying Lady Alymir Glynlamin

The leader of the Aymeluma, **Lady Alymir Glynlamin** (NG elf noble woman), does
not place herself above the rest of the elves in the village. She has lead the
village for 100 years and over that time she has come to believe in their
tradition of support through community.

However, Lady Glynlamin is at odds with the Council of Elders and doesn't trust
them as much as she wants to. She knows they hide a secret about the past of the
village but has failed to get any useful information about them. She will only
admit this to those that she trusts and she will swear them to secrecy.

From the war against Elydir that Lady Glynlamin lived through childhood (though
she didn't know the cause), she has a fear of violent conflict and will avoid it
at all cost. Because of this, the village barely has a militia. During conflict,
she will hide. She is ashamed of this and wishes she could face her fears.

Recently, Lady Glynlamin has had the hard task of leading Aymeluma through
disaster after disaster. While the villagers has worked hard to support one, she
has realised that. She will welcome whatever support from outside the village.

If questioned about the gold oak leaf amulet, she will say it was stolen from
her years ago, along with a book about Silvanus, but they never found out who it
was. She can confirm that the gold oak leaf amulet is hers.

She is reluctant to let people into her study as there is sensitive information
about the Aymelumans in there.

#### Roleplaying Aien, the house-servant

**Aien** (CN elf commoner man) is lazy, sarcastic, and often insulting. Since
the disasters in the village, he has been shirking his evening job of watching
the house to drink at the Easing Water. He will blatantly lie about this, even
if caught. He is usually hungover.

Aien has some information that might be useful to the party, though he will want
a price (10gp) to be paid for it:

- He has been keeping Lady Glynlamin's cowardice a secret, hoping to make the
  most out of it.
- There is a tension between Lady Glynlamin and the Council. Aien has heard an
  argument about the Council hiding something from Glynlamin.
- The main set of keys to the house are missing, though he won't give that he
  was drunk when they went missing.

If asked about the golden amulet, he will talk about how it was stolen a few
years ago, along with a book about Silvanus from the library.

### Council of Elders

![Council of Elders map](/images/council-of-elders.png)

> An ornate stone building with large wooden doors. Two decorative pillars show
> rising suns. Outside the building are three large well maintained bushes,
> growth creeping out under them.

There are three vine blights, each hiding under the large well maintained
bushes. These are controlled by Maiele. She will only use them if she feels
threatened by the characters.

#### 1. Public chambers

> There's a small stage at the far end of the room with a reading plinth.

The doors to the other rooms are labelled with the inhabitants or purpose in
elvish. Each of the doors to the personal rooms, apart from the private chambers
are locked. A character who succeeds on a DC 16 Dexterity check will be able to
unlock the doors.

#### 2. Private chambers

> There's a large table in the centre of the room with three chairs around it.
> One cabinet is stocked with papers, the other is stocked with tableware.
> Opposite the main entrance is a well stocked fire, keeping the room warm.

The cabinet contains papers relating to the laws of the village.

The council will usually meet in here between noon and dusk, for business and
for dinner.

#### 3. Kitchen and pantry

> The kitchen smells of bread and fruit. The pantry is well stocked.

There is nothing of interest in this room.

#### 4. Records room

> Shelving of books and scrolls fill this room.

It's easy to find the treaties with neighbouring areas, including the pact with
the Silvatans, not to expand into each others land. It's easy to see that this
has been followed.

The text is to do with the history of the village and its inhabitants. If
characters investigate for a day and succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence
(Investigation) check, they will find that there is a lack of history from
around 500 years ago in here through missing references.

#### 5. Servant Orihil's room

While the door to this room from the public chambers is locked, the door to the
kitchen is unlocked.

> This tidy room is for both work and rest. There's a narrow bed on one side. A
> window provides a little light to the room. A small desk has a set of keys on
> it. A large wash tub filled with pinkish water has a purple cloak draped over
> the side.

The keys on the desk will open the doors to the council members rooms.

The purple cloak is Maiele's with a wine stain - the stain is barely out of it.

#### 6. Elder Ilphas's room

> Bookcases surround the walls of this room. A bed is pushed up against the
> bookcases on one wall. A desk up against the wall opposite the door.

The table has draft law about the import on magical items, like potions of
healing. The library is mostly books about law from places near and far.

#### 7. Elder Maiele's room

> This room is very tidy and empty. On the left hand side is a bed and
> meditation area. In the centre is an empty desk, apart from a single key. On
> the other side is a wardrobe.

If the characters open the wardrobe, read the following description:

> The wardrobe is partly full, with many items. There is a chest at the bottom.

The chest in the wardrobe is locked. The chest is trapped and if it's opened
without pressing the buttons on either side, it will trigger a cloud of
**Malice** poison gas within 10 ft of the chest. A character who succeeds on a
DC 12 check will notice the buttons on the side. If a character succeeds on a DC
17 Dexterity check, they can unlock the chest with thieves tools. If a
characters succeeds on a DC 14 Strength check, they can break the chest open -
this will trigger the gas.

Inside the box is the following:

- A signet ring with oak leaf. This is a forgery created by Maiele to create the
  fake letter from Lady Aymeluma.
- A book about Silvanus (stolen from Lady Glynlamin's library).

#### 8. Elder Alasse's room

> This bedroom room is filled of small trinkets and items. A writing desk is
> covered with papers and a small library overflows with books.

This is Alasse's room.

If searched, the characters will find there are a few books on the ethics of
magic. Her journal will be filled with thoughts about whether or not the
Swornight is effective.

#### Council lore

In addition to the information known to the Aymelumans, the council members know
the following lore:

- Lady Glynlamin suffered violent conflict in her childhood and is unable to
  defend the village from conflict.
- They think lady Glynlamin does not trust them and is up to something.
- The world was warm before Elydir.
- Their families final act of magic was to create the hot springs that keep
  their areas safe.
- Lady Glynlamin's father followed Silvanus.

#### Roleplaying the Council of Elders

The Council of Elders each lived through Elydir's reign and destruction of their
people. They have agreed to never discuss Elydir with the village - that the
secret will die with them.

**Elder Ilphas** (LN elf noble man) believes in the law. He is a very serious
man, with little humour. Through fear of magic, following Elydir's wrath, he
created and officiates the Swornight ceremony. He is unforgiving for any who
break those rules, no matter the circumstances, though he will not use force or
violence but will instead seek to isolate the rule breaker. Many of the village
follow his thoughts on this. Ilphas will be critical of any solution the
characters bring to them about the _attack in the night_.

**Elder Maiele** (NE elf noble woman) is Elydir's older sister and secretly
worked with her when she was in power, out of anger for how the village sold
her. She knows that Elydir is still alive. She works in two ways against the
village: use the tradition of no magic to weaken them, and to frame Lady
Glynlamin for the disasters happening to the village. She believes that this
revenge will bring peace.

**Elder Alasse** (NG elf noble woman) believes the village should take a softer
approach the restriction of magic through education to prevent it from being
used again. However, she does not have the will to go against Ilphas and Maiele,
though she is more likely to side with Ilphas. She hopes to outlive Ilphas and
Maiele and bring around a positive change for the village.

**Servant Orihil** (LE elf common man) works closely with Maiele, being
corrupted with bribes. He spies on the other Elders for Maiele which helps her
know their secrets. He will decline to speak to anybody but the Elders, as his
job keeps him so busy - though he is efficient at it. He will speak against
Maiele if it's in his interest.

### Shafina residence

**TO DO**

#### Roleplaying the Shafina family

**TO DO**

### Fires of the Spring - Smithy

> A warm light flickers from the door of this building and smoke billows from
> the chimney. A sign hangs with elvish text on it and a steaming river.

The elvish text says _Fires of the Spring_.

> The smithy fire burns hot in the centre of the room. Gold, silver and iron
> bars are stacked on one side. Agricultural and builders equipment is stacked
> on the other. A single sword is hung up on the opposite wall to the entrance.

The blacksmith, Ena Magphine the Strong (CG elf commoner woman), is a burly
woman who is well mannered and smart. While she works in a smithy, she believes
you need to be in touch with nature and take good care of yourself. She believes
you should just try to get along rather than control one another.

Ena has traded with the Silvatans before, with gold, and they have always been
friendly. She knows that their past relations have been good, with agreements to
keep to their own lands. She saw a figure cloaked in purple enter the Elders
very late last night, while she was locking up. She will be will be reluctant to
speak badly about the Elders and will appear nervous when questioned.

### The Easing Water - Inn

> A sign hangs from the inn, with a painting of a steaming pool with a bare
> chested man relaxing in it, text in elvish below it. The outside is decorated
> with swirling patterns like steam and flowing water.

Inside the inn:

> The inn is small and decorated blue and white. A large fireplace keeps the
> room warm. A small bar with bottles of wine and wine glasses fill the shelves
> on the back wall.

The text in elvish reads _The Easing Water_.

The innkeeper, Uldreiyn Caigeiros (TN elf innkeeper man) is very perceptive. He
believes it is important to do what feels good and likes to chat about rumours
and things he's seen.

If the characters stay to have a drink, he will be willing to talk to them about
the goings on of the town. In addition to the general lore, he also knows that
Aien is often drinking at the pub in the evenings when he's meant to be working
and that he was even that drunk once that Elder Maiele had to take him home.

Aien was at the inn last night during the **attack in the night** but Uldreiyn
asked him to leave early after he drank too quickly.

The bar sells only the grape wine grown locally for 1sp per glass.

### Grainsheaf Farm

![Map of Grainsheaf Farm](/images/grainsheaf-farm.png)

> A marble single story farmhouse faces out to the north to large wheat fields.
> Wind flows across the tall wheat, which looks limp and pale.
>
> Beyond, a dark pine forest looms.

The farm owned by Kendel and Toross Umelee, two married male elves. The farm has
been suffering from the failing springs and their crops are weakened because of
it.

#### Roleplaying the Umelee family

**Kendel Umelee**. Broader than most other elves, Kendel (NG male elf commoner)
is fiercely protective of Toross and the farm. He has heard of the recent wolf
attacks to the other farms and has carried. He carries a scythe to defend his
family and a horn to warn the rest of the village. While he is an expert farmer,
Kendel has no experience fighting with the scythe.

He believes that the wolves aren't after food but are controlled by something
evil as they have only been attacking people.

**Toross Umelee**. Sceptical of the Kendel's ideas about the wolves, Toross (N
male elf commoner) is worried about Kendel's plans to defend the farm.

#### 1. Boot room

> The smell of mud and dirt fills the air. Dirty boots and smaller farming
> equipment is stored on the right. There is one wooden door opposite you and
> one to the left.

#### 2. Dining room

> The furniture is delicately but simply crafted. A table and chairs in the
> centre of the room, and a cabinet against the wall. There is a door to the
> left.

#### 3. Kitchen and store

The door to this room is locked.

#### 4. Parlour

Simple, well loved furniture. Painting of Kendel and Toross.

#### 5. Bedroom

Single double bed.

#### 6. Barn

Horse and equipment in barn.

### Forest clearing

To the south of the village is a large clearing in the forest. This is often
used for village festivals.

### Silvanus Shrine

The shrine is to the north west of the village, just off the path to Silvat.

> In a small clearing just beyond a small, a carved wooden statue of a
> semi-draped man holds out an oak branch. Its legs appear to grow out from the
> stone plinth. The stone plinth has an oak leaf carved into it. The area is
> kept clean, though a few dead shrubs rustle in the wind around it.

Below the statue is a hidden box. Inside the box is a sealed with an oak leaf
signet, which has been planted by Elder Maiele. The letter says the following:

> B. Attack the remaining farm tomorrow. Kill the inhabitants. AG

If a character succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, they will notice a
stone gap built into the base of the statue. If the golden oak amulet is placed
into the stone plinth, it will unlock. If a character succeeds on a DC 17
Strength check to move the base, they will break the stone apart the stone base.
If they succeed on a DC 13 Strength check, they can break the legs of the statue
and get into the stone plinth from above.

If the handwriting or seal is compared to a real Lady Glynlamin's character
succeeds on an DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation check), they will notice
inconsistencies.

If a character succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check, they will
find tracks leading to the Council of Elders.

When the characters try to leave the shrine, 12 **Twig Blights**, created by
Elder Maiele will attack the characters.

## Special events

### Wolf attack

This event happens when the characters first arrive at the village. To the north
of Grainsheaf farm, wolves begin to attack. Immediately, the Kendel Umelee of
the farm will sound a horn and then Toross will run to the village.

> You hear a long horn blast to the north. A few seconds later you hear a man
> shouting "the wolves are attacking our farm, they're getting my husband."

Four wolves are attacking the elves at the farm, aiming to attack the people and
not any livestock or other animals. These wolves can't be frightened off but
will flee when two of the wolves have been killed.

Add the following description to the [Grainsheaf farm](#grainsheaf-farm):

> Almost hidden by the wheat, you see an elf (Kendel) swinging a scythe at two
> wolves who are approaching him. Another wolf jumps out from the wheat at him.

Once the wolves have been killed or driven off, the characters will be urged to
seek Lady Glynlamin by most bystanders. Lady Glynlamin will be shaken by the
attack. She will offer 50gp to the party for finding the source of the attacks
and another 50gp for stopping them.

### Attack in the night

This event happens when the characters return from fighting the wolves.

Lady Glynlamin has been attacked by Elder Maiele during the night using
\_Vicious Mockery_to mock her cowardice. Elder Maiele entered through the door
left unlocked as Aien was drinking at the Easing Water. Before the attack, she
placed a golden leaf in her office. Elder Maiele has suggested, to the council,
that Lady Glynlamin has fabricated this event to deflect from her recent
failings - which the council agree could be a possibility.

While there are no physical wounds, Lady Glynlamin will be feverish and
inconsolable about her cowardice and will be reluctant to talk about what
happened to her. If a character succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check
to get information, she will tell them the following:

- She was attacked during the night.
- The attacker shouldn't have been able to get in past Aien.
- The attacker spoke unfamiliar words and then cursed her for her cowardice.
- The attacker fled after hearing a noise downstairs, but said "You're lucky to
  get another night, coward."
- She couldn't see the attacker because of a cloak and the dark - but it was a
  woman's voice.

Read the following description when the characters arrive in the village:

> The village looks empty, you don't see anybody around. You can hear noise
> coming from the village square.

Read the following description if the characters reach the square:

> The noise comes from the tall building to the west.

Read the following descriptions if the characters enter the Council of Elders,
if it is the characters first time visiting the Council of Elders, read the
description of the building:

> Inside the main room, a restless crowd is gathered. Three of the ancient elves
> stand in front of the crowd, two women and a man. Many of those in the crowd
> turn to look at you.
>
> After a few minutes, as the noise quietens, the man says "Lady Glynlamin was
> attacked during the night. She survived and is recovering. We will find
> investigate what happened."
>
> The crowd will then disperse.

The council will greet the party. They will ask what they found out about in the
forest so far - they will give the reward promised by Lady Glynlamin.

They will explain that Lady Glynlamin says she was attacked in her house at
night, though she shows no wounds. The council will ask them to investigate what
happened. If the characters talk of the involvement of the wolf attacks with
Sylvanus, the council will say that Lady Glynlamin's father was a follower. The
council will suggest that they are concerned that the attack could be fabricated
to distract from her failings. They will ask them to bring the answer to them.

During the characters investigation, Elder Maiele will send 3 vine blights to
attack the characters. She will attempt to use this to banish the characters
from the village due to their trouble making.

### Invasion

As part of getting vengeance on the...

#### Approaching the village

When the players approach the village after the invasion, read the following
description.

> There's a stench on the wind. An oppressive, malignant smell. Blood. Smoke.
>
> Through the trees, you can see glimpses of the ornate stone buildings with
> walls charred.

All of the buildings are either fully destroyed or

#### Village square

When the characters arrive in the village square:

> The stench of destruction is overpowering here.
>
> The small river flows serenely, despite the terrible scenes in front of you.
> On the north side of the river, you can see a small town square, dark click
> red patches cover the paved square.
>
> Most of the other buildings have collapsed, their contents smouldering and
> their white husks blackened. Cracking stains of carmine are scattered along
> their walls. There are broken carved pillars and arches - hints of the
> elaborate patterns and ornate structures.
>
> On the west side of the town square, a slightly larger building is still
> mostly standing. Its walls are blackened, like most of the others, and you can
> see that the ceiling has collapsed in a few places.

If the characters have got to this village within a day of the attack Denaura,
if they make a successful DC20 Wisdom (Perception) check to hear if anything is
in the area, they will hear what sounds like distant shouting to the south.

Investigation checks DC15 will show signs of dragged bodies to carts and tracks
to the south.

#### Hiding girl

If the players have made it to the village within three days of the attack, they
will find a young elven girl, Shyrrik Shafina trapped in the Glynlamin
residence. She will shout for the players if she sees or hears them.

She will want her mother, Pharom Shafina, who she saw being dragged away by
orcs. She will remember seeing a cloaked figure with the orcs.

If they fail to make it within three days, they will find Shyrrik Shafina's body
instead.

This is the larger building in the town, the walls are blackened like most of
the others and some of the ceiling has collapsed on parts but the

The doors outside the building show the symbol of Elydir, on them.

Piled in the centre of the room is smouldering furniture and books.

#### The prophecy

Within the Glynlamin residence, the prophecy.

> The liar <span class="invisible">tricks them</span> to unbind.\
> <span class="invisible">Her</span> lover fights again and <span class="invisible">fails.</span>\
> The raider strikes <span class="invisible">at all their</span> kind.\
> Her <span class="invisible">captor flees</span> to mountain trails.\
> <span class="invisible">The caster's</span> end to search
> <span class="invisible">and find,</span>\
> Her fighter tells <span class="invisible">his ancient</span> tales.

#### Orc encampment

For two days after the invasion, there will be an orc encampment.

Within this encampment, there are about twenty-five elves are in cages; one of
the elves looks like Elydir but younger. There are ten large orcs are camping.

A black ornate tent is next to the fire. The same symbol on the messenger stone
is on the tent. Two orogs guard this tent. Inside the tent, is Qa'por. If she
sees the players, she will try to attack them and subdue them, to capture them
for torture.
