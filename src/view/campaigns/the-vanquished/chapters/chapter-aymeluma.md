Nestled within a valley, the famed hot springs of Aymeluman give life a
chance to flourish, or at least to give respite from the harsh
mountainous lands of Denau. In the ancient elvish village of Aymeluma,
people live simple lives. Good soils and warm air gift the elves with
prosperous farming and many Aymelumans sing to Chauntea for this
blessing.

Over the recent months, life hasn't been as easy as this for the
Aymelumans. There have been wolf attacks from the Forest of Beasts to
the North East and the springs have been running cold. Lady Alymir
Glynlamin, like her ancestors before her, leads Aymeluma, but the
village doesn't have the power to defend itself. She hopes her call for
help to neighbouring villages and other lands will bring safety back to
her village.

Only the Council of Elders know the terrible secret of Elydir's
heritage, that she was one of them and they will take this secret to the
grave. The oldest of the elves swore to never let this happen again.
When each elf reaches the age of 13, they make a vow never to use magic.
Born after the reign of Elydir, Glynlamin is unaware of her relation to
the village.

## Aymeluman lore

In addition to the information known to all Denians, Aymelumans know the
following lore:

- The villagers are ashamed of their natural magical powers. When they
  reach the age of 13, each of them makes a vow never to use them.
- Attacks are usually rare from the Forest of Beasts but recently
  there's been wolf attacks.
- It's dangerous to go hunting in the Forest of Beasts, especially
  at night, and it is difficult to track things in there. The villagers
  will avoid doing so.
- The springs are running cold. The village's prayers to Chauntea have
  failed.
- Some Aymelumans believe that the village has been cursed.
- Lady Glynlamin has been missing during the wolf attacks and, after the
  attacks she appears to be ill.

## Areas of the village

![Map of Aymeluma](/images/aymeluma-map.svg)

### Village square

When the characters first enter the village square, read the following
description:

> Marble buildings surround the village square. Two grand buildings,
> one to the east and the west stand taller than the others.
>
> In the centre of the village square is a statue of woman sewing seeds.
> In front of it, five elves sing in beautiful harmony, offering fresh
> fruit and dried to the statue.
>
> Through the square, you can hear the river Ayme rush under a small
> marble bridge, adding to the harmony of the elves.

#### Market

The market runs on every seventh day of each tenday. Available at the
market are: a baker, fresh goods, dried goods, a fletcher, a clothier,
a blacksmith, and a carpenter. The fresh goods are limited due to the
springs running cold. The craftspeople will have a small number of
common goods and will accept commissions for twice the price.

### Glynlamin residence

> This building, to the east of the square, is clean polished marble
> which looks more grown than built. The walls gently curve and there's barely
> a crack between the stones. A small garden has overgrown.

#### Entrance hall

> The grand entrance hall's stairs are fashioned after oak trees. The stairs
> begin to climb up opposite to the entrance and split off back, to a hidden
> balcony above. Before the stairs split, a grand tapestry showing a woman
> sowing seeds, trees around them, and the sun rising behind. There's a door
> to the left and right

When the characters reach the balcony:
> The balcony looks down onto the stairs inside, and a window looks out to
> the village square. There's a door to the left and to the right

#### Roleplaying Lady Alymir Glynlamin

The leader of the Aymeluma, **Lady Alymir Glynlamin** (NG elf noble
woman), does not place herself above the rest of the elves in the
village. She has lead the village for 100 years and over that time she
has come to believe in their tradition of support through community.

However, Lady Glynlamin is at odds with the Council of Elders and
doesn't trust them as much as she wants to. She knows they hide a secret
about the past of the village but has failed to get any useful
information about them. She will only admit this to those that she
trusts and she will swear them to secrecy.

From the war against Elydir that Lady Glynlamin lived through childhood
(though she didn't know the cause), she has a fear of violent conflict
and will avoid it at all cost. Because of this, the village barely has a
militia. During conflict, she will hide. She is ashamed of this and
wishes she could face her fears.

Recently, Lady Glynlamin has had the hard task of leading Aymeluma
through disaster after disaster. While the villagers has worked hard
to support one, she has realised that. She will welcome whatever support
from outside the village.

#### Roleplaying Aien, the house-servant

**Aien** (CN elf commoner man) is lazy, sarcastic, and often insulting.
Since the disasters in the village, he has been shirking his evening job
of watching the house to drink at the Easing Water. He will blatantly
lie about this.

#### Hidden prophecy

There is a prophecy hidden on the back of the main tapestry - it is
unknown to Alymir and its origin is unknown.

> The liar tricks them to unbind.\
> Her lover fights again and fails.\
> The raider strikes at all their kind.\
> Her captor flees to mountain trails.\
> The caster's end to search and find,\
> Her fighter tells his ancient tales.

### Council of Elders

> An ornate building with large wooden doors

The Council of Elders each lived through Elydir's.

#### Council lore

In addition to the information known to the Aymelumans, the council
members know the following lore:

- The precise location of the Silvanus Druids.
- Lady Glynlamin suffered violent conflict in her childhood and
  is unable to defend the village from conflict.
- They think lady Glynlamin does not trust them and is up to something.
- The world was warm before Elydir.
- Their families final act of magic was to create the hot springs that
  keep their areas safe.
- Lady Glynlamin's father followed Sylvanus.

#### Roleplaying the Council of Elders

The council of elders have agreed to never discuss Eldyir with the
village - that the secret will die with them.

**Elder Ilphas** (LN elf noble man) believes in the law. He is a very
serious man, with little humour. Through fear of magic, following
Elydir's wrath, he created and officiates the Swornight ceremony. He is
unforgiving for any who break those rules, no matter the circumstances,
though he will not use force. Many of the village follow his thoughts on
this.

**Elder Maiele** (NE elf noble woman) is Elydir's older sister and
secretly worked with her when she was in power, out of anger for how the
village sold her. She knows that Elydir is still alive. She works in two
ways against the village: use the tradition of no magic to weaken them,
and to frame Lady Glynlamin for the disasters happening to the village.
She believes that this revenge will bring peace.

**Elder Alasse** (NG elf noble woman) is

### Grainsheaf Farm

> A marble single story farmhouse faces out to the north to large wheat
> fields. Wind flows across the tall wheat, which looks limp and pale.
>
> Beyond, a dark pine forest looms.

The farm owned by Kendel and Toross Umelee, two married male elves. The
farm has been suffering from the failing springs and their crops are
weakened because of it.

#### Roleplaying the Umelee family

**Kendel Umelee**. Broader than most other elves, Kendel (NG male
elf commoner) is fiercely protective of Toross and the farm. He has
heard of the recent wolf attacks to the other farms and has carried. He
carries a scythe to defend his family and a horn to warn the rest of
the village. While he is an expert farmer, Kendel has no experience
fighting with the scythe.

He believes that the wolves aren't after food but are controlled by
something evil as they have only been attacking people.

**Toross Umelee**. Sceptical of the Kendel's ideas about the wolves,
Toross (N male elf commoner) is worried about Kendel's plans to defend
the farm.

#### 1. Boot room

> The smell of mud and dirt fills the air. Dirty boots and smaller
> farming equipment is stored on the right. There is one wooden door
> opposite you and one to the left.

#### 2. Dining room

> The furniture is delicately but simply crafted. A table and chairs in
> the centre of the room, and a cabinet against the wall. There is a

### Forest clearing

To the south of the village is a large clearing in the forest. This is
often used for village festivals.

## Special events

### Wolf attack

This event happens when the characters first arrive at the village. To
the north of Grainsheaf farm, wolves begin to attack. Immediately, the
Kendel Umelee of the farm will sound a horn and then Toross will run to
the village.

> You hear a long horn blast to the north. A few seconds later you hear
> a man shouting "the wolves are attacking our farm, they're getting my
> husband."

Four wolves are attacking the elves at the farm, aiming to attack the
people and not any livestock or other animals. These wolves can't be
frightened off but will flee when two of the wolves have been killed.

Add the following description to the [Grainsheaf farm](#grainsheaf-farm):

> Almost hidden by the wheat, you see an elf (Kendel) swinging a scythe
> at two wolves who are approaching him. Another wolf jumps out from the
> wheat at him.

Once the wolves have been killed or driven off, the characters will be
urged to seek Lady Aymeluma by most bystanders. Lady Aymeluma will be
shaken by the attack. She will offer 50gp to the party for finding the
source of the attacks and another 50gp for stopping them.

### Attack in the night

This event happens when the characters return from fighting the wolves.

Lady Glynlamin has been attacked by Elder Maiele during the night using
_Vicious Mockery_, using it to mock her cowardice. Elder Maiele entered
through the door left unlocked as Aien was drinking at the Easing Water.
Before the attack, she placed a golden leaf in her office. While there
are no physical wounds, Lady Glynlamin will be feverish and inconsolable
about her cowardice.

Read the following description when the characters arrive in the
village:

> The village looks empty, you don't see anybody around. You can hear
> noise coming from the village square.

Read the following description if the characters reach the square:

> The noise comes from the tall building to the west.

Read the following descriptions if the characters enter the Council of
Elders:

> Inside the main room, a restless crowd is gathered. Three of the
> ancient elves stand in front of the crowd, two women and a man. Many
> of those in the crowd turn to look at you.
>
> After a few minutes, as the noise quietens, the man says "Lady
> Glynlamin was attacked during the night. She survived and is
> recovering. We will find investigate what happened."
>
> The crowd will then disperse.

The council will greet the party. They will ask what they found out
about in the forest so far - they will give the reward promised by
Lady Glynlamin.

They will explain that Lady Glynlamin says she was attacked in her
house at night, though she shows no wounds. The council will ask them to
investigate what happened. If the characters talk of the involvement
of the wolf attacks with Sylvanus, the council will say that Lady
Glynlamin's father was a follower.

### Invasion

As part of getting vengeance on the...

#### Approaching the village

When the players approach the village after the invasion, read the
following description.

> There's a stench on the wind. An oppressive, malignant smell. Blood.
> Smoke.
>
> Through the trees, you can see glimpses of the ornate stone buildings
> with walls charred.

All of the buildings are either fully destroyed or

#### Village square

When the characters arrive in the village square:

> The stench of destruction is overpowering here.
>
> The small river flows serenely, despite the terrible scenes in front
> of you. On the north side of the river, you can see a small town
> square, dark click red patches cover the paved square.
>
> Most of the other buildings have collapsed, their contents smouldering
> and their white husks blackened. Cracking stains of carmine are
> scattered along their walls. There are broken carved pillars and
> arches - hints of the elaborate patterns and ornate structures.
>
> On the west side of the town square, a slightly larger building is
> still mostly standing. Its walls are blackened, like most of the
> others, and you can see that the ceiling has collapsed in a few
> places.

If the characters have got to this village within a day of the attack
Denaura, if they make a successful DC20 Wisdom (Perception) check to
hear if anything is in the area, they will hear what sounds like distant
shouting to the south.

Investigation checks DC15 will show signs of dragged bodies to carts and
tracks to the south.

#### Hiding girl

If the players have made it to the village within three days of the attack,
they will find a young elven girl, Shyrrik Shafina trapped in
the Glynlamin residence. She will shout for the players if she sees
or hears them.

She will want her mother, Pharom Shafina, who she saw being dragged away
by orcs. She will remember seeing a cloaked figure with the orcs.

If they fail to make it within three days, they will find Shyrrik Shafina's
body instead.

This is the larger building in the town, the walls are blackened like
most of the others and some of the ceiling has collapsed on parts but
the

The doors outside the building show the symbol of Elydir, on them.

Piled in the centre of the room is smouldering furniture and books.

#### The prophecy

Within the Glynlamin residence, the prophecy.

> The liar <span class="invisible">tricks them</span> to unbind.\
> <span class="invisible">Her</span> lover fights again and <span class="invisible">fails.</span>\
> The raider strikes <span class="invisible">at all their</span> kind.\
> Her <span class="invisible">captor flees</span> to mountain trails.\
> <span class="invisible">The caster's</span> end to search <span class="invisible">and find,</span>\
> Her fighter tells <span class="invisible">his ancient</span> tales.

#### Orc encampment

For two days after the invasion, there will be an orc encampment.

Within this encampment, there are about twenty-five elves are in cages;
one of the elves looks like Elydir but younger. There are ten large orcs
are camping.

A black ornate tent is next to the fire. The same symbol on the
messenger stone is on the tent. Two orogs guard this tent. Inside the
tent, is Qa'por. If she sees the players, she will try to attack them
and subdue them, to capture them for torture.
