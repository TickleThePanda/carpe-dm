Nestled within a valley, the famed hot springs of Aymeluman give life a
chance to flourish, or at least to give respite from the harsh
mountainous lands of Denau. In the ancient elvish village of Aymeluma,
people live simple lives. Good soils and warm air gift the elves with
prosperous farming and many Aymelumans sing to Chauntea for this
blessing.

Over the recent months, life hasn't been as easy as this for the
Aymelumans. There have been wolf attacks from the Forest of Beasts to
the North East and the springs have been running cold. Lady Alymir
Glynlamin, like her ancestors before her, leads Aymeluma, but the
village doesn't have the power to defend itself. She hopes her call for
help to neighbouring villages and other lands will bring safety back to
her village.

Only the Council of Elders know the terrible secret of Elydir's
heritage, that she was one of them and they will take this secret to the
grave. The oldest of the elves swore to never let this happen again.
When each elf reaches the age of 13, they make a vow never to use magic.
Born after the reign of Elydir, Glynlamin is unaware of her relation to
the village.

## Aymeluman lore

In addition to the information known to all Denians, Aymelumans know the
following lore:

- The villagers are ashamed of their natural magical powers. When they
  reach the age of 13, each of them makes a vow never to use them.
- Attacks are usually rare from the Forest of Beasts but
- It's dangerous to go hunting in the Forest of Beasts, especially
  at night, and it is difficult to track things in there. The villagers
  will avoid doing so.
- The springs are running cold. The village's prayers to Chauntea have
  failed.

## Areas of the village

### Village square

When the characters first enter the village square, read the following
description:

> Marble buildings surround the village square. Two grand buildings,
> one to the east and the west stand taller than the others.
>
> In the centre of the village square is a statue of woman sewing seeds.
> In front of it, five elves sing in beautiful harmony, offering fresh
> fruit and dried to the statue.
>
> Through the square, you can hear the river Ayme rush under a small
> marble bridge, adding to the harmony of the elves.

#### Market

The market runs on every seventh day of each tenday. Available at the
market are: a baker, fresh goods, dried goods, a fletcher, a clothier,
a blacksmith, and a carpenter. The fresh goods are limited due to the
springs running cold. The craftspeople will have a small number of
common goods and will accept commissions for twice the price.

The farm owned by Kendel and Toross Umelee, two married male elves. The
farm has been suffering from the failing springs and their crops are
weakened because of it.

#### Roleplaying the Umelee family

**Kendel Umelee**. Broader than most other elves, Kendel (NG male
elf commoner) is fiercely protective of Toross and the farm. He has
heard of the recent wolf attacks to the other farms and has carried. He
carries a scythe to defend his family and a horn to warn the rest of
the village. While he is an expert farmer, Kendel has no experience
fighting with the scythe.

He believes that the wolves aren't after food but are controlled by
something evil as they have only been attacking people.

**Toross Umelee**. Sceptical of the Kendel's ideas about the wolves,
Toross (N male elf commoner) is worried about Kendel's plans to defend
the farm.

the north of Grainsheaf farm, wolves begin to attack. Immediately, the
Kendel Umelee of the farm will sound a horn.

Four wolves are attacking the elves at the farm, aiming to attack the
people and not any livestock or other animals. These wolves can't be
frightened off but will flee when two of the wolves have been killed.

following description.

#### Village square

> of you. On the north side of the river, you can see a small town
> square, dark click red patches cover the paved square.
>
> Most of the other buildings have collapsed, their contents smouldering
> and their white husks blackened. Cracking stains of carmine are
> scattered along their walls. There are broken carved pillars and
> arches - hints of the elaborate patterns and ornate structures.
>
> On the west side of the town square, a slightly larger building is
> still mostly standing. Its walls are blackened, like most of the
> others, and you can see that the ceiling has collapsed in a few
> places.

If the characters have got to this village within a day of the attack
Denaura, if they make a successful DC20 Wisdom (Perception) check to
hear if anything is in the area, they will hear what sounds like distant
shouting to the south.

Investigation checks DC15 will show signs of dragged bodies to carts and
tracks to the south.

#### Hiding girl

If the players have made it to the village within three days of the attack,
they will find a young elven girl, Shyrrik Shafina trapped in
the Glynlamin residence. She will shout for the players if she sees
or hears them.

She will want her mother, Pharom Shafina, who she saw being dragged away
by orcs. She will remember seeing a cloaked figure with the orcs.

If they fail to make it within three days, they will find Shyrrik Shafina's
body instead.

This is the larger building in the town, the walls are blackened like
most of the others and some of the ceiling has collapsed on parts but

The doors outside the building show the symbol of Elydir, on them.

A black ornate tent is next to the fire. The same symbol on the
