Nestled within a valley, the famed hot springs of Aymeluman valley
gives a chance for life to flourish, or at least to give respite from
the harsh mountainous lands of Renauria. In the ancient elvish village
of Aymeluma, people live simple lives, isolated from the rest of
Renauria. Good soils and warm air gift the elves with prosperous
farming and many Aymelumans sing to Chauntea for this blessing.

Lady Alymir Glynlamin, like her ancestors before her, leads Aymeluma's
people.

Oral tradition.

#### Approaching the village

When the players approach the village after the invasion, read the
following description.

> Smoke.
>

> with walls charred.

All of the buildings are either fully destroyed or

#### Village square

When the characters arrive in the village square:

> The stench of destruction is overpowering here.
>
> You can see around 12 limestone buildings, a river flowing from west
> to east splitting the village in two. The small river flows serenely,
> despite the terrible scenes in front of you. A small stone bridge
> crosses the river. On the north side of the river, you can see a small
> town square, dark click red patches cover the paved square.
>
> Most of the other buildings have collapsed, their contents smouldering
> and their white husks blackened. Cracking stains of carmine are
> scattered along their walls. There are broken carved pillars and
> arches - hints of the elaborate patterns and ornate structures.
>
> On the west side of the town square, a slightly larger building is
> still mostly standing. Its walls are blackened, like most of the
> others, and you can see that the ceiling has collapsed in a few
> places.

If the characters have got to this village within a day of the attack
Renaura, if they make a successful DC20 Wisdom (Perception) check to
hear if anything is in the area, they will hear what sounds like distant
shouting to the south.

Investigation checks DC15 will show signs of dragged bodies to carts and
tracks to the south.

#### Hiding girl

If the players have made it to the village within three days of the attack,
they will find a young elven girl, Shyrrik Shafina trapped in
the Glynlamin residence. She will shout for the players if she sees
or hears them.

She will want her mother, Pharom Shafina, who she saw being dragged away
by orcs. She will remember seeing a cloaked figure with the orcs.

If they fail to make it within three days, they will find Shyrrik Shafina's
body instead.

This is the larger building in the town, the walls are blackened like
most of the others and some of the ceiling has collapsed on parts but
the

The doors outside the building show the symbol of Elydir, on them.

Piled in the centre of the room is smouldering furniture and books.

#### Orc encampment

For two days after the invasion, there will be an orc encampment.

Within this encampment, there are about twenty-five elves are in cages;
one of the elves looks like Elydir but younger. There are ten large orcs
are camping.

A black ornate tent is next to the fire. The same symbol on the
messenger stone is on the tent. Two orogs guard this tent. Inside the
tent, is Qa'por. If she sees the players, she will try to attack them
and subdue them, to capture them for torture.
