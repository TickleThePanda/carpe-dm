type: "Chapter"
index: 7
---

The Wellspring of Vitality flows and warms. The bitter cold of Denau makes it
impossible for many to survive but the Wellspring's hot waters gives life a
chance to endure and, at times, thrive.

The origins of the springs have been forgotten by most. A final alliance between
Aymeluma and Silvat combined magic with the nature of the fire deep in the
mountain when the cold arrived from Elydir over 500 years ago.

Worshippers of the ice beings in this land want to bring more cold to this
region. They have twisted the purpose of the enchanted gems of this spring,
which enhance the power of the molten earth below, to freeze the incoming
water - preventing the flow of new hot water.

Now the power of the springs is waning, and soon, all those who live in its
warmth could perish.

### Outside

Approaching from a distance:

> You glimpse the nearing mountains through the tops of the trees. The hills
> getting steeper towards the mountains. As you climb, the wind bites and whips
> at you.

From close by:

> The trees give way to a 30ft semi-circular clearing below a cliff, the tall
> mountains hiding the sky above. An entrance to a cave tunnel is 10ft up the
> cliff face. Four thuggish humans huddle around a fire in the clearing below,
> pelts and tents breaking the wind. A figure cloaked in ice blue stands in the
> cave entrance, mostly looking out and occasionally scowling down at the people
> below.

The thugs and cultist fanatic have been told by the cultists to defend the
entrance of the caves and not let anybody in. They will aim to discourage others
from entering before fighting (it's easier money to not die).

The cultist at will to warn the other cultists inside that others are coming.

A character must succeed on a DC 13 check to climb up the cliff-face.

### Upper cave

#### B1. entrance tunnel

> The natural tunnel twists into the mountain, frost covers the surfaces. With
> each step the air gets colder but stiller.

Each of the other tunnels in the cave are also frosty and cold. The ones that

#### B2. lake room

> An irregular trench cuts across this cavern from east to west, a thick layer
> of ice covering the bottom. At either end of the channel is a smaller tunnel.
> To the north, opposite to the entrance, a passageway is blocked by fallen
> rock. The cavern is 30ft at its widest, 20ft at its tallest, and 40ft long.
> The channel is 20ft wide in the middle, 10ft wide at the edges, and 10ft deep.
>
> In the space south of the trench, you see fragments of a shattered stone
> tablet on the floor, below a podium with a missing tablet.
>
> Inside the channel, twelve cloaked figures, robed in icy blue chanting. A
> small spectral orb floats in the centre of the room above them, thick snow
> spilling out of it.

The ice worshippers are chanting to open a small portal to the ice realm. They
will accelerate their efforts if they are interrupted, aiming to open a smaller
unstable portal. At the end of each round, check if the ice worshippers are
successful in opening a portal. Roll 1d20, if the result is less than the number
of cultists chanting, open a portal in the centre of the room, bringing in 1d4
ice mephits. This can be done at most 10 times in 24 hours.

If the characters inspect the broken fragments, give the characters the dungeon
puzzle.

#### B3. east waterfall

> A waterfall of ice flows down the east wall into a channel running from east
> to west. At the end of the channel is a tunnel to the east. The cave has a
> tunnel to the north. Set into the ice at the top of the waterfall is a large
> blue gem.

The blue gem is a [Nixignis Gem]. Once removed, the waterfall stays frozen for
24 hours. Treasure

> A waterfall of ice flows down the north east wall into a channel running from
> north east to south west. At the end of the channel is a tunnel. To the north
> west and south west of the cave are two tunnels.

> Inside the ice at the bottom of the channel, a small package and a lantern is
> sunk.
>
> Five angular winged creatures with blue skin breath fly near the waterfall.
> One breaths frosty breath onto it.
