The Wellspring of Vitality flows and warms. The bitter cold of Denau makes it
impossible for many to survive but the Wellspring's hot waters gives life a
chance to endure and, at times, thrive.

The origins of the springs have been forgotten by most. A final alliance between
Aymeluma and Silvat combined magic with the nature of the fire deep in the
mountain when the cold arrived from Elydir over 500 years ago.

Now its power is waning, and soon, all those who live in its warmth could
perish.
