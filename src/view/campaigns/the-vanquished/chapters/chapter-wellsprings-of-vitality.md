title: "Wellsprings of Vitality"
type: "Chapter"
index: 7
---

The Wellspring of Vitality flows and warms. The bitter cold of Denau makes it
impossible for many to survive but the Wellspring's hot waters gives life a
chance to endure and, at times, thrive.

The origins of the springs have been forgotten by most. A final alliance between
Aymeluma and Silvat combined magic with the nature of the fire deep in the
mountain when the cold arrived from Elydir over 500 years ago.

The [Icebringer's Ictus] have twisted the purpose of the enchanted gems of this
spring, which enhance the power of the molten earth below, to freeze the
incoming water - preventing the flow of new hot water.

Now the power of the springs is waning, and soon, all those who live in its
warmth could perish.

### Outside

Approaching from a distance:

> You glimpse the nearing mountains through the tops of the trees. The hills
> getting steeper towards the mountains. As you climb, the wind bites and whips
> at you.

From close by:

> The trees give way to a 30ft semi-circular clearing below a cliff, the tall
> mountains hiding the sky above. An entrance to a cave tunnel is 10ft up the
> cliff face. Four thuggish humans huddle around a fire in the clearing below,
> pelts and tents breaking the wind. A figure cloaked in ice blue stands in the
> cave entrance, mostly looking out and occasionally scowling down at the people
> below.

The thugs and cultist fanatic have been told by the cultists to defend the
entrance of the caves and not let anybody in. They will aim to discourage others
from entering before fighting (it's easier money to not die).

The cultist at will to warn the other cultists inside that others are coming.

A character must succeed on a DC 13 check to climb up the cliff-face.

### Upper cave

The upper cave is cold and icy. The cultists have wrestled control over it and
have frozen the waterfalls.

#### B1. Entrance tunnel

> The natural tunnel twists into the mountain, frost covers the surfaces. With
> each step the air gets colder but stiller.

Each of the other tunnels in the cave are also frosty and cold.

#### B2. Lake room

> An irregular trench cuts across this cavern from east to west, a thick layer
> of ice covering the bottom. Inside the channel, twelve cloaked figures, robed
> in icy blue chant. The figure closest to the back wears larger and brighter
> robes. A small spectral orb floats in the centre of the room above them, thick
> snow spilling out of it.
>
> At either end of the channel is a smaller tunnel. To the north, opposite to
> the entrance, a passageway is blocked by fallen rock. The cavern is 30ft at
> its widest, 20ft at its tallest, and 40ft long. The channel is 20ft wide in
> the middle, 10ft wide at the edges, and 10ft deep.
>
> In the space south of the trench, fragments of a shattered stone tablet lie on
> the floor, below a podium.

If the characters enter the channel, read the following description:

> At the bottom of the channel, below the ice, two thick veins of metal runs
> through it. The channel slopes upwards slightly to the east.

The bottom of the channel is **slippery ice** (DMG p110).

One of the ice worshippers is a [cult fanatic], Morrow, the others are
[cultists]. The ice worshippers are chanting to open a small portal to the ice
realm. They will accelerate their efforts if they are interrupted, aiming to
open a smaller unstable portal. At the end of each round, check if the ice
worshippers are successful in opening a portal. Roll 1d20, if the result is less
than the number of cultists chanting, open a portal in the centre of the room,
bringing in 1d4 ice mephits. This can be done at most 10 times in 24 hours.

If the characters inspect the broken fragments, give the characters the dungeon
puzzle.

The blocked passage leads to the passage opposite B6, the channels leading to
the east and west portions of B3.

#### B3. Water channels

> The icy floor is difficult to walk on and the cold seeps through your boots.
> Two thick metal veins follows underneath the ice.

When the water is following, it is difficult to travel through the channels.

If the character falls into the water, they must make a DC 14 Strength saving
throw or be swept downstream, taking 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage.

The bottom of the channel is **slippery ice** (DMG p110).

##### East

This connects area B2 to areas B4 and B5, the passage splitting as it goes
along.

##### West

This cuts across the main passageway (area B6), between areas B8 and B9, then
curves towards area B9, joining the channel from area B8.

#### B4. East waterfall

> A waterfall of ice flows down the east wall around a vein of thick metal into
> the channel. Set into the ice at the top of the metal vein is a large blue
> gem.

A tunnel to the north leads to B5 and the channel leads to B2.

The blue gem is a [Nixignis Gem]. Once removed, the waterfall will slowly melt
over 24 hours.

#### B5. North east waterfall

> A waterfall of ice flows down the north east wall around a vein of thick metal
> into a channel.
>
> A skeleton lies in the corner, a small pack to its side.
>
> Five angular winged creatures with blue skin breath fly near the waterfall.
> One breaths frosty breath onto it.

The tunnel to the north is the entrance to area B6.

There are five [ice mephits] in this room who are trying to keep the waterfall
frozen until the cultists sent below return with the final gem. If they are
stopped, this waterfall will melt in 6 hours.

If a character succeeds on a DC 13 medicine check, they will find that the
skeleton belongs to an elf. On the skeleton, is a **[Ring of Fire Resistance]**.
The pack contains a **[Lantern of Revealing]**, and 12gp.

#### B6. Main passage

> This walls of this stone passage are smooth. The moss on the walls turned to
> ice. Sounds echo along this otherwise silent corridor.

This passage starts at area B5 and connects to areas B7, B8, and B9. Between
areas B8 and B9, the west water channel (area B3) cuts across this. A passage to
B2 is blocked.

If the characters reach the west water channel for the first time, read the
following description.

> A channel cuts across this corridor, ice at the bottom.

After the waterfalls have been melted and the characters reach the water
channel, read the following description:

> Water rushes through the channel in this corridor, spraying on each side.

#### B7. Stairs

> From carved stone stairs, warmer air rises and, with it, a smell of damp and
> mildew. Water trickles down the steps from slowly melting ice.
>
> On each side of the stairs, a stone statue of an elf stands, each with their
> hands outstretched and a rising sun emblazoned across their robes. At the
> bottom of the stairs is a dark room.

These are [Fire-breathing] statues, with the fire coming out of their hands. The
pressure plate covers the space across the stairs.

The stairs start connected to B6 down to C1.

#### B8. North west waterfall

> This is a very cold cave. A waterfall of ice flows down from the north west
> into a channel. Inside the ice, one foot in, you see a blue gem.
>
> Two figures cloaked in elegant blue robes stand watching the cave entrance.

Two [cult fanatics] guard the gem in this waterfall, talking about the flying
serpents below.

#### B9. Whirlpool

> Carved into the ground of this large cave is a huge funnel, 30 feet across,
> its walls coated in ice. At the bottom, a 5 foot wide dark void swallows the
> dim light of the room. A channel from the north connects parallel to side of
> the funnel, at the point closest to the entrance. Three metal veins, starting
> from the channel, spiral around and turn into ice covered poles, equidistant
> down the funnel's hole.
>
> A skeleton lies in the corner of the cave.

The bottom of the channel is **slippery ice** (DMG p110).

If a character succeeds on a DC 13 medicine check, they will find that the
skeleton belongs to an elf. Between the bones is a spell scroll of [Stone Shape]
and 2 gems worth 10 gp each.

### Lower cave

The lower cave is warmer than the upper levels, though it's not hot. The
cultists have struggled to gain control over this level. Initially, they
travelled with force to steal the Nixignis gems from the deep but were thwarted
by the Couatls, Tlene and Icpi, though Tlene was also slain in the process.

#### C1. Stairs

> Warmer air flows from two carved stone corridors, one to the east and one to
> the west.

#### C2. East reservoir

> At the centre of this giant basin, a hunched older man sits near a small fire,
> staring into it, a bag of weapons to his side. Closer to the man, a mound,
> shaped in a crescent is covered in a sheet.
>
> At the edge of the basin, to the east, a few small bunched mounds are covered
> by a white sheet. Nearby those, two unconscious robed figures are tied up.
>
> To the north of the basin stands a 30 foot tall slimy cliff atop which a
> tunnel exits. A boat hangs down the wall, chained to the top of the cliff. A
> 10 wide channel opens into the basin, 20 feet up the south west wall, the
> shadows beyond impenetrable.

The channel in the south west wall of the basin leads to area C4. The tunnel
leads to area C1.

The man at the centre is **Icpi**, Icpicoualt, (LG [Couatl] male) in the form of
a [Veteran] male. Icpi is mourning the loss of his mother, Tlene
(Tlenenepilcoualt), and is planning on burning her body. He has been tasked by
his mother, and therefore the gods, to prevent the power of the Nixignis gems
from being used for ill. Icpi is not quick to trust others and will be fearful
of. He will use his abilities to mind read copiously, and be very questioning of
any other creature's purpose here. He will be evasive of any questions and will
try to lead others seeking the Nixignis Gems away. If he believes there are
those that will help, he will ask them to return the Nixignis Gems to their
rightful place and to drive any remaining cultists from the caves. In return, he
will warn them of what is likely to happen once the water flows again and will
offer to help them escape when the time comes.

Beneath the white sheet closest to Icpi is the corpse of Tlene. Under the other
sheet are corpses of the cultists who failed. Icpi is also planning on burning
those corpses, out of respect, though he doesn't know that this would be
blasphemous to them. If a character succeeds on an DC 12 Intelligence
(Investigation) check, they will see that none of the corpses have weapon marks
on them, but bite marks.

The fire at the centre of the cavern is incredibly hot, despite its small size.
At the centre of it, is a [Nixignis Gem].

A character who attempts to scale the cliff, either up or down must make a DC 14
Athletics (Strength) check or fall, taking fall damage. If a character attempts
to climb around the cavern, they must succeed on a DC 16 Athletics (Strength)
check or fall.

#### C3. West reservoir

> This large cave has an empty basin. A makeshift ladder climbs down the 30ft
> slimy cliff, at the top of which a tunnel exits further to the north east.
> Strewn around the bottom of the ladder, slime covered corpses lie disfigured.
>
> To the south, 20ft up the basin wall, a dark tunnel stares out at you.

The tunnel to the north east leads to C1, the tunnel to the south leads into C4.

At the bottom of this cave are three [gelatinous cubes], staying perfectly
still. One is directly at the bottom of the ladder, waiting for an unlucky
visitor.

A character who attempts to scale the cliff, either up or down must make a DC 14
Athletics (Strength) check or fall, taking fall damage. If a character attempts
to climb around the cavern, they must succeed on a DC 16 Athletics (Strength)
check or fall.

#### C4. Water passages

> The tunnel floor and lower walls are smooth and slippery. Stalactites hang
> down from the ceiling.

This passage connects areas C2 and C3 to area C5.

#### C5. Stairs to the deep

> This large square room has been slowly softened by time. A plateau, 40ft high
> and 20ft wide, stands in the centre of the room. A 10 foot wide staircase
> climbing around it, the stairs very worn at the bottom half. Four statues
> stand atop it, watching out to below, the air around shimmers like the air on
> a hot summer's day. The smell of sulphur fills the room. Two corpses lie
> broken at the bottom of the room. To the north east and south west, tunnels
> exit 20ft up into room.

The statues are [animated armour] and will activate when people stand on the
steps.

#### C6. Whirlpool
