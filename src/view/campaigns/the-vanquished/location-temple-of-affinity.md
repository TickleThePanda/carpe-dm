This is also known as the Temple of the Corrupt Orb. This is where the
Ith has been kept safe from the world, and the world safe from Ith.
Inside the temple, the Orb can detect the thoughts and feelings of any
creature. Additionally, it can speak to any creature telepathically.

The temple is _Hallowed_ cast at 8th level, excluding Celestials from
the standard effects. The spell also has the additional effect, all
humanoids in the area cannot be frightened.

> You find the hidden passage that Faurin told you about. It leads you
> into a deep gorge, though the stream has ran dry. The passage winds
> back and forth until you reach an opening. The gorge widens and you
> see the stars above. Ahead, a temple, its stone worn, built across the
> gorge. Pillars decorate the front. The forest is creeping down into
> the gorge but it has left the temple untouched.
>
> Above the door, celestial script is engraved.

The celestial script says "Speak the Password to Free the Orb".

### The Temple Entrance

> The door opens. Inside, there's a small room, only 15ft wide and 10ft
> along. The walls are cracked and the floor dusty. In the quiet, the
> air rings a continuous high pitched. Ahead of you are two doors, both
> closed.
>
> On the wall across the room, text is engraved on the wall. Though you
> don't recognise the script but each of the players hears a voice
> speak:
>
> > Beware, those who enter here,
> > Of what you seek.
> > We know not if it is evil,
> > Or strong or weak.
> > It hears your thoughts and feeling,
> > As if you speak.

> The door opens into a much larger room, dust covers the floor. In the
> centre of the room, at the top of a stepped pyramid, a statue stands a
> reddish orb at its heart.

If the players have worked in unity and are in unity at this point, the
orb will leave its housing.

If the players haven't worked in unity or are not working in unity at
this point, it will fight them.

It is a _Shield Guardian_ with a bonus of +9 to hit instead because of
its ability to read thoughts. It will try to stay at the top of the
pyramid and will push them down.
