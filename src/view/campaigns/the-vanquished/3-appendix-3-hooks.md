> It's been a week since you have freed the City of Renaura from
> Qa'lir's control. Since then, you've been paid a 250gp each to help
> secure the city from the creatures remaining here and the castle.
> You've made good progress and are to meet with Lady
> Pertana, who is still ruling the city in the place of King
> Morcant. During this time you've seen a lot of things:
> constructs made by Qa'lir fight anything around them; stationed wights
> murder innocents; and lots of fleeing cultists
>
> Right now, you're in Lady Pertana's study discussing the progress
> in protecting the city. Pertana is sitting at her desk. There are
> papers piled and an empty glass of wine. Her eyes are bloodshot and
>
> "We've been able to bring in some more of our guards from the
> surrounding areas," Pertana says. "We've seen an abatement in the
> reports of bandit and goblin attack which is a great relief.
>
> "I'm very grateful for the work that you've been putting in over the
> past week. Without your help, I'm doubtful that the city will have

> A piercing screech interrupts Pertana, "for what you have done -
> Meriele, Elmon, and Aseir - you will know _only_ pain."
>
> You each hear a whisper of a discordant melody and are wracked with a
> terrible pain. The room spins and your vision blurs.

At this point, ask the characters to make a Wisdom Saving Throw (DC 19).
On a failed save, the characters take 5d6 psychic damage. On a
successful save, the characters take half.

> The melody subsides. After reorientating yourselves, you realise that
> the sound seemed to come from Meriele.
>
> Pertana is standing and looking shocked and concerned but looks
> unharmed. She is pointing at Meriele and says "What _was_ that! It
> came from you!"
