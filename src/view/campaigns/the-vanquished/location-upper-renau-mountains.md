## The Hall of Mydaiel the Patient

> Up the final set of stairs, you are led into a grand hall, the ceiling
> over 100ft tall. A huge stained glass window depicting the Triad
> sparkles in the starry Lunia light. Sitting in a huge throne atop a
> large set of stairs is a 9 foot tall, a handsome muscular winged
> creature with opalescent emerald skin. A large sword, still in its
> scabbard, leans against the throne.
>
> A Trumpet Archon floats aside and Hound Archons are positioned at the
> bottom of the stairs and by the entrance you just entered through.

Mydaiel the Patient is a _Planetar_ who serves the Triad. He is there to
make sure that those in Lunia are not fiends or elementals and don't
mean any harm to the land. He will use his _truesight_ to see creatures
original forms. He will question visitors about their intent in Lunia,
using his _Divine Awareness_ to tell if a creature is lying. He knows
that the administrators at Hope's Ingress will know whether any creature
has arrived here after dying and may know where they are.

If the players are welcome, they will be given a Mark of Mydaiel to
prove that they are safe here.

## Temple of the Triad

This is a temple devoted to the Triad. It's surrounded by a walled
garden. The temple is in the shape of a cross. The main temple hall is
devoted to the Triad, at the base of the cross. The other ends to the
cross are shrines devoted to Tyr, Torm, and Ilmater.

```

Within the walled garden is the temple, is the residency of the priests
and acolytes, and a healers.

A dwarf priest, Mandoun, will be available to speak to visitors and will
agree to provide services, for example, helping to find Faurin, if the
players find the [missing Lantern Archon,
Zuriel](#trapped-lantern-archon).

They will find Faurin using the spell _Divination_, speaking to Ilmater.

The missing Lantern Archon is trapped. It was last seen travelling
towards a shrine of Lathander, outside the city.

## Shrine to Lathander

Nearby, along a path up the mountain, there's a shrine to Lathander,
off the path into some woods. There's a statue of a man holding a baby.

Here, a halfling woman Caramella, a Succubus (Briglin) in disguise will
let the players know that she saw the Lantern Archon fly off into the
woods "looking for a cave" (see [Trapped Lantern
Archon](#trapped-lantern-archon) encounter). A successful Wisdom
(Insight) check of 20 will see that this is a lie. She will offer to go
with them as she knows the woods well.

## Travelling Around Lunia

Most of the safest paths require travelling up the mountain, to meet
another path that goes down the mountain which is time consuming and
exhausting.

While Lunia is generally a safe place, off the paths the players may
encounter creatures who are trying to get into Lunia.

Various travelling descriptions:

- > The road uphill is tiring. Few people pass you on the way down, but
  > you overtake many on the way up.
- > A few people stop and ask if you need help or assistance on the
  > journey and help point you in the right direction.
- > You pass a large selection of shrines to all the god of good.
- > Back down the hill, you travel through a village.
- > The ashen trees sway in the breeze on either side of you. The
  > beauty from this vantage point is breathtaking.

## Safer route encounters

If the party choose to follow an safe route, along the paths, across the
terrain, roll a d8 every 6 hours of travel: on a 1-3, choose the event
with the number rolled below.

### Band of Hound Archon Soldiers

> From the distance, you see a band of Hound Archons orderly marching
> towards you.

As they approach the players, a few of the soldiers will stop and ask
for a Mark of Mydaiel from the players. If they don't have one, they
will be asked to be escorted to the Hall of Salutation

### Stubborn Priest

> You reach a bridge over a 20ft wide waterfall which drops down into a
> pool 50 ft below. A human, dressed in robes, holding a symbol of
> Ilmater stands in your way and shouts:
>
> "Travellers, you may not pass over this bridge unless you are worthy."

A human priest, Nol, he will not let them over unless he be believes
are good or lawful enough. He is a commoner. He will not stop them if
they try to climb across the edge of the bridge, or if they try to wade
through the water.

On a successful DC 17 Strength check, a character can wade through the
river. On a failure, they will be swept away, and down over the
waterfall, taking 5d6 bludgeoning damage.

On a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, a character can climb across the
edge of the bridge. On a failure, they will fall into the water and need
to make a DC 17 Strength save or fall over the edge and take 5d6
bludgeoning damage.

An alternative away around will add another 4 hours of journey.

### Invisible Stalker

This is an attack from an _Invisible Stalker_ sent by Morcanloth, if she
knows who the players are. If he doesn't, then ignore this encounter.

> A sharp wind blows across the tops of the trees to your right in a
> line. It's quiet otherwise.

Pick a random player to be attacked first by an _Invisible Stalker_.

## Unsafe route encounters

The unsafe routes will take the characters through forests and along
steep mountain passes.

If the party choose to follow an unsafe route, across the terrain, roll
a d8 for every 6 hours: on a 1-4, choose the event with the number
rolled below. If you have rolled it already before, nothing happens.

Various travelling descriptions:

- > You walk through a deep forest, the trees ashen, the light from the
  > stars light your path.
- > You pass an dwarf who helps you for a short while in the right
  > direction.
- > You pass a shrine to Eldath at the base of a waterfall. A few
  > pilgrims are here.
- > You carefully walk along a mountain cliff path.

### Corrupted lantern

Deep pass and a corrupted lantern:

> You're on a narrow path, about 10 foot wide, hugging along the side of
> a cliff, dropping down 30ft to the right. The path is unstable on the
> right and doesn't hold you well.
>
> A slow red pulsating light is in the distance, darting around sharply
> and randomly.

Approaching the red light:

> As you get closer the light stops. It looks like an Archon Lantern.
> It holds still for a moment before flying towards you.

Roll initiative. This has the stats of an **Archon Lantern**.

### Mauled body

> You're deep in the woods, You find a mauled body of a male elf, scratched and bruised. It
> doesn't look like it's been around for long, blood still pouring
> around it.

A **Nycanloth** will try to attack the players stealthily. A perception
check of DC 14 will reveal the Nycanloth.

### Trapped Lantern Archon

> Surrounded by the ashen trees you see a cave, deep and dark. You can
> smell a dampness and must, something you've not smelt since you've
> arrived in Lunia.

The entrance is trapped with a falling net, a successful DC 17 Wisdom
(Perception) will allow a character to spot the trap. A successful DC 15
Dexterity check using thieves' tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly.
Without thieves' tools, it is done at a disadvantage with an edged
weapon or tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.

When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot
square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and Restrained,
and those that fail a DC 14 Strength saving throw are also knocked Prone.
A creature can use its action to make a DC 14 Strength check, freeing
itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC
10 and 20 Hit Points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net destroys a
5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature in that section.

If here with Briglin, she will encourage the characters inside the cave
while she waits outside. If they become trapped, she will use this
opportunity to attack them. If they're not here with Briglin, she will
arrive a minute after the trap is set off.

Inside the tunnel:

> The entrance of the cave is a 15ft tunnel, leading into a wider room.
> It is dark apart from a flickering shining light at the end of the
> tunnel. Water drips down the walls. You hear a musical crying in the
> distance.

At the end of the tunnel:

> The tunnel opens out into a darker room, 15ft square. In the centre of
> the room is a small pile of treasure, on the top of which is a
> lantern. The lantern is roughly made of a dark metal decorated with
> evil demonic faces faces on each of the top corners, each staring out.
> Inside the lantern is a Lantern Archon, faded and pale, crying.

The Lantern Archon, Zuriel, is trapped in this lantern. The lantern can
be opened by anybody.

The characters will find:

- 150gp
- 100sp
- 500cp
- a small golden statue of Lathander, worth 200gp

### Skree slope

> You reach a fork in the narrow path you're following. Straight ahead,
> the path has loose rock strewn around, you hear some rocks falling and
> scraping in the distance. To the left, you see a path that goes up the
> mountain with more even footing far in the distance.

Going up the mountain will add another 2 hours to the journey. Going
along the scree, the players must make a DC 12 dexterity check or take
2d6 bludgeoning damage.
