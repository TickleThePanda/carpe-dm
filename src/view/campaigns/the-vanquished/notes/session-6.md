### Session plan

- During the night, Maiele ([cult fanatic]) will attack with Orihil ([spy]),
  aiming to kill Lady Glynlamin and try to escape:

  - Spooky events:

    1. > The night is unnaturally quiet.
    2. > You hear a rustle in the courtyard.
    3. > Bang! A door slams below you.
    4. > An hour passes, every sound louder for silence of night.
    5. > The fire goes out, plunging the room into darkness.
       >
       > A chanting starts, filling the room.
       >
       > The windows and door slam open.
       >
       > A cloaked woman stands at the door, eyes glowing red, a shimmering
       > field surrounding her. A floating spectral short sword hovers at her
       > side.

  - Tactics:
    - Fight defensively
    - Pull the fight away from Lady Glynlamin
    - Use Orihil to sneak in and kill her
    - Use the environment escape

- Revive Lael?
