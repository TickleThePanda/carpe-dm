Use a second set vine blights to attack them if they go to the hot springs

### Council

A bystander to the intimidation of the blacksmith has spoken to the council. The
council will send Servant Orihil to request their audience at the thirteenth
hour.

Remind the characters about the doors, each with the names of the elves.

The council wants to talk about:

- What progress they've made so far?
- Why are they intimidating villagers? Demand that they don't in the future.
- What else are they going to do to prevent and catch the attacker before
  tonight?
- Maiele will state two things:
  - A worry that Lady Glynlamin might be faking it to distract from her failings
    in defending the village.
  - She saw Lady Glynlamin go to the statue of Silvanus the other night.
