### Easing Water Inn

- Ask about what they found out about the Forest of Beasts
- Silvanus connection:
  - Villagers use the shrine nearby
  - Occasional visits to trade from the nearby druids
- Aien:
  - Maiele took him home one night

### Council

A bystander to the intimidation of the blacksmith has spoken to the council. The
council will send Servant Orihil to request their audience at the thirteenth
hour.

Remind the characters about the doors, each with the names of the elves.

The council wants to talk about:

- What progress they've made so far?
- Why are they intimidating villagers (disappointed in Aien)?
- What else are they going to do to prevent and catch the attacker before
  tonight?
- Remind them that they have a whole day to investigate before night.
- State a worry that Lady Glynlamin has faked it to distract from her failings.
- Have they searched Lady Glynlamin's house for any evidence about it being
  faked?

Will Maiele attack them with the vine blights after the audience?
