### Description

> It's midday outside the Wellspring. Despite the warmth below, the surface is
> cold and the wind bites at you; the corpses of the thugs frozen on the ground.
> While the sun is out for you, to the east, the weather looks dark.
>
> To get here, you first journeyed North to Sylvat, and then West to the
> Wellsprings. To your South East, directly to Sylvat are the lower foothills of
> the Denau mountains. Lael knows the foothills could be faster but are more
> dangerous.

### Silvat

The village of Silvat will welcome their return, celebrating their victory. They
will offer to cure wounds twice for to the characters and gift two health
potions.

### Aymeluma

The village will be in and out of discussions on how to effectively lead the
village in the Council of Elders building.

In the Council of Elders building, Lord Ilphas and Lady Alasse's rooms will be
empty. The other ex-leaders will be living in separate accommodation. Ilphas
will be trying to influence the future of the village to keep the Elder's
voices.

Lady Glynlamin will appear to be mostly recovered, though will still look tired.

### Shrine of Silvanus

If the characters get there by the 8th dusk:

> The sun sets in the small clearing, lighting the carved wooden statue of
> Silvanus. Its legs appear to grow out from the stone plinth. The stone plinth
> has an oak leaf carved into it.

If they approach afterwards:

> The clearing has a carved wooden statue of Silvanus. Its legs appear to grow
> out from the stone plinth. The stone plinth has an oak leaf carved into it.

If the characters wait for 1 hour, Orihil will be told to go to the shrine by
Orihil.

#### Servant Orihil

> A man limps out of shadows of the forest into the clearing. You recognise the
> Servant Orihil. Where he looked refined and tidy before, his clothes are torn
> and his dirty skin is covered in bruises and gashes.

Orihil has been asked by Elydir to cast the direction of blame elsewhere. He
will blame Prince Morcant, the current leader of Denaura (the nearby city)
citing ancient tensions between the cities. He will say that they have allied
with Silvanus. He will keep the explanation short.

If a character succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check against Orihil, they
will notice there is something odd about Orihil's speech, it seems a bit
delayed, as if he was remembering a script or being told what to say.

If a character succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence (Religion) check, they will
notice it's odd that Silvanus is allying with a city.

Orihil will refuse to go into any more detail, whether or not he is caught
lying, on fear of death or worse. He will try to flee if he feels threatened.

#### Elydir

Elydir is angry that the characters have thwarted her plans, preventing her from
causing problems in Aymeluma. Elydir doesn't believe that the characters know
who she is yet.

Elydir is shifting her focus to trying to get herself freed. She believes the
characters have enough skill to retrieve her amulet and could be of use to her
through manipulation.

Elydir will observe the any interaction between the characters and with Orihil
using [Scrying]. She will use the [Sending] spell to instruct Orihil what to
say, or threaten him.
