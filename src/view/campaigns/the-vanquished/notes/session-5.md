### Session plan

- Maiele will use the blights to weaken the party:
  - 2 vine blights to attack the house
    > You hear shouting from the courtyard. Tangles of vines from the garden
    > below lurch up the building.
  - 5 [twig blights] to attack the shrine
    > The bushes surrounding the shrine jerk sharply.
- During the night, Maiele ([cult fanatic]) will attack with Orihil ([spy]),
  aiming to kill Lady Glynlamin and try to escape:
  1. > The night is unnaturally quiet.
  2. > You hear a rustle in the courtyard.
  3. > Bang! A door slams below you.
  4. > An hour passes, every sound louder for silence of night.
  5. > The fire goes out, plunging the room into darkness.
     >
     > A chanting starts, filling the room.
     >
     > The windows and door slam open.
     >
     > A cloaked woman stands at the door, eyes glowing red.
