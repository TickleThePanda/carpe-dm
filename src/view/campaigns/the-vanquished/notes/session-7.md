### Session plan

It's colder today.

> The air seems colder today - the village not as warm as it had been before.

#### Travel to Silvas

Donkey knows that Silvas is about two hours away and that she can avoid most
things, thought the forest is dangerous and there's no guarantees of safety. If
they follow Donkey:

> You follow Donkey's lead through the cold coniferous trees - the understory of
> snow and debris from the trees making it difficult travel. It is very cold.

##### Encounter on the path

- 4 [Giant Poisonous Snakes]
- 1 [Swarm Poisonous Snakes]

> After an hour of travelling, you notice an area of green, about 100ft away,
> and 60ft across, standing out from the snow and trees.

If they approach:

> Ferns and mosses cover the area. Something doesn't seem right. The ferns are
> drooping and the moss is icy. A path is carved out through the ferns and
> mosses.

Inside:

> The greenery surrounds a pool of water, a thin layer of ice forming on the
> surface. Hundreds of small broken eggs surround the pool.

The players must succeed on a DC 13 perception check to notice the snakes.

If the players go around the ferns, they must succeed on a DC10 group stealth
check or be attacked by the snakes.
