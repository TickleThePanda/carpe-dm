Small village with a tavern called _The Watchers Tavern_, the
accommodation is modest.

The players may hear about the rumours.

### The Watchers

Outside the tavern:

> The tavern leans against its neighbours, the tiled roof sagging. Warm
> light spills out of the windows and boisterous chatter emanates,
> inviting you in from the quiet cold and dark. You can smell wood smoke
> and charred meat.

Inside the tavern:

> The moment you open the door, warm air floods out. The must of tobacco
> smoke and spices fill the room, combining with the smoke and charred
> meat. The many merry patrons chatting loudly amongst themselves hardly
> look over, though one shouts, "Get in! Quickly! You're letting the
> warmth out." A few people keep to the corners, alone and cloaked
> but little attention is paid to them.
>
> The bar has a few people being served at the bar by a young teen boy.

The bar serves cheap wine, reasonable ale, and cider. Some spiced meats
can be served as well.
