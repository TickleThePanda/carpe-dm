> Smoke.

> Through the trees, you can see glimpses of ornate stone buildings.

When arriving at the village:

> The stench of destruction is overpowering here.
>
> You can see around 12 limestone buildings, a river flowing from west
> to east splitting the village in two. The small river flows serenely,
> despite the terrible scenes in front of you. A small stone bridge
> crosses the river. On the north side of the river, you can see a small
> town square, dark click red patches cover the paved square.
>
> Most of the other buildings have collapsed, their contents smouldering
> and their white husks blackened. Cracking stains of carmine are
> scattered along their walls. There are broken carved pillars and
> arches - hints of the elaborate patterns and ornate structures.
>
> On the west side of the town square, a slightly larger building is
> still mostly standing. Its walls are blackened, like most of the
> others, and you can see that the ceiling has collapsed in a few
> places.

Renaura, they will find a young elven girl, Shyrrik Shafina trapped in
one of the ruined buildings. She will shout for the players if she sees
or hears them.

She will want her mother, Pharom Shafina, who she saw being dragged away
by orcs. She will remember seeing a cloaked figure with the orcs.

If they fail to make it within a day, they will find Shyrrik Shafina's
body instead.

most of the others and some of the ceiling has collapsed on parts but

#### The prophecy

On one of the walls, there's a partially damaged ornate

> <span class="invisible">When</span> she tricks <span class="invisible">the wandering</span> three to unbind,<br>
> The shadow <span class="invisible"> of her</span> lover will fight but fail.<br>
> When she <span class="invisible">brings</span> destruction to <span class="invisible">all of his</span> kind,<br> > <span class="invisible">The</span> soul of her <span class="invisible">lover her end</span> will detail.<br> > <span class="invisible">Now the</span> wandering three <span class="invisible">his</span> soul they <span class="invisible">must find</span><br>
> On divine slopes <span class="invisible">her fate his soul</span> will unveil.

Originally, this would have read the following:

> When she tricks the wandering three to unbind,<br>
> The shadow of her lover will fight but fail.<br>
> When she brings destruction to all of his kind,<br>
> The soul of her lover her end will detail.<br>
> Now the wandering three his soul they must find,<br>
> On divine slopes her fate his soul will unveil.

## Nearby enemy encampment

If the players get to the enemy encampment within 2 days of leaving
Renaura then they will find the following. Otherwise, they will find
evidence of the following.

About twenty-five elves are in cages. One of the elves looks like Elydir
but younger.

Ten large orcs are camping there.

A black ornate tent is next to the fire. The same symbol on the
messenger stone is on the tent. Two orogs guard this tent.

Inside the tent, is Qa'por. If she sees the players, she will try to
attack them and subdue them, to capture them for torture.
