### DM comments

 - NPCs need to have stronger flaws
 - Need to play to my strengths and have fewer pure "people" based
   encounters
 - Be tougher on the players
 - Don't rush
 - Mount Celestia is a really hard plane to play - characters need to be
   more complex and have less flaws
 - Vary the types of encounter
 - Remember to take passives at start of game
 - Make choices harder, 
 - Give better item to rogue
