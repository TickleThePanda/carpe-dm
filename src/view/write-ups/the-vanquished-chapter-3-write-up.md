The trio met with Pertana, after spending the last week killing the
monsters, constructs, and cultists which were remaining in the city.
During the meeting, Qa'por sent a message to the three, threatening them
for what they had done, using the sending stone that Meriele looted from
Qa'lir's body, and a glyph of warding on the stone was set off,
psychically injuring them. Meriele, revealed the stone with Elydir's
symbol on it after keeping it secret from the others.

Elmon suggests that they speak to the castle librarian about the stone
and the three travel there. He identifies the stone as a sending stone
and the glyph is a glyph of warding. He also identifies the main symbol
on the sending stone - though not the additional symbol of the broken
chain underneath - as the symbol of Glynlamin family lead the nearby
village Aymeluma. He gives them the location of this village and the
quickest way to get there. He also gives them a bit of information about
the city and the nearby elven village - that there was a marriage
arranged between an elf and the previous royal family hundreds of years
ago, though most of this information had been lost by the Mad Lord
Morcant. He recommends they travel there to find out more information
about this symbol, especially given the longevity of the elves, and
that, if they're going via the mountains, to get some warmer clothes.

The three adventurers decide to get some winter gear from the markets
and speak to a travelling merchant named Cheda (not a corgi!), they ask
him about the village Aymeluma, suspicious about the occupants. They
find out that the people there are quite insular but haven't seemed like
bad people to the travelling merchant.

The trio decide to travel to Aymeluma, though not until the following
day. They stay at the Dragons Claw to get some food and sleep, Meriele
avoids everybody in there (getting free food and drinks), Aseir tries to
meet Glanna, and Elmon performs for the occupants of the tavern.

They set off before dawn the following day, making the most of the
travelling time.

Fight and defeat wolves
 - horse's involvement

Reach top of mountain with sign pointing towards the Cloud-peak
Monastry or Aymeluma
 - Elmon tries to make skis

Back down the other side of the mountain
 - A few landmarks

See village in the distance, but smell smoke and blood

Aseir rides ahead to the village to see what's going on, Meriele
climbs a tree
 - heard distant shouting
 - heard the girl
 - saw the symbol of Elydir
 - asked Meriele to look for signs of distant shouting

Aseir and Meriele tried to help the girl
 - she's scared of the monsters that took the family
 - wants her mother
 - convinced to come with on the horse

Elmon explored the building, found and shared the prophecy:
 - Faurin may be the lover
 - Elydir may be the person causing the destruction
 - Divine slopes may be the monastry that they saw the sign for,
   concerned about what they might face there

Left the girl in the large building with the horse

Looked for the ruined apocethary, finding some potions

Decide to leave the village in search for the distant shouting,
sneaking out

Manage to sneak to the encampment
 - 10 orcs around a campfire
 - 2 orogs guarding a tent, symbol of Elydir on it
 - cages to the right hand side of the tent filled with elves, one
   of the elves looked similar to Elydir

Elmon tricks most of the orcs away using minor illusion while

Meriele and Aseir kill the remaining orog

Meriele and Aseir free the elves while Elmon makes it look like
cages are full still, with an illusion

Elmon and Aseir took the elves back to the village

Meriele looks into the tent to see what's going on then returns to
the village

Aseir reunited the child with the mother

Aseir spoke to the elf that looked similar to Elydir
- enquired about what happened and who they were taken by, the elf
  gave Qa'por's name
- spoke about Elydir, elf said she betrayed everybody but she was
  now dead
- Aseir broke the news that she wasn't dead and that they may have
  freed her
- elf said that was bad (we're all in grave danger)
- enquired about the prophecy and the elf came to the realisation
  that the prophecy may be about those people
- she gave the background of the prophecy that it was written 200
  years ago by her great aunt

Elf started helping people leaving quickly

The party hear shouting and screaming in the distance, and an
explosion, and they saw flames

Party received a message from Qa'por blaming them and threating them

Quickly discussed a plan, and decided to go back to the orc camp

They saw orcs corpses, and orcs trying trying to fight her, but she
kills lots of the orcs in one word. She also continues to set the forest
on fire.

While discussing the next steps, Qa'por disappears

Party stay the night in the village, deciding to travel to the monastry
the following day. Rest only briefly interrupted by a bear

Start travelling up the mountain, before dawn again, reaching the fork
in the road without any hinderance, it looks like the elves did go in
the direction of the city

Travelling up towards the monastry, seeing an abandoned mine shaft on
the way.

Eventually reached an area where the weather calmed down, and the clouds
and snow clear completely. Temple in the distance, looking dilapidated.
Walked towards the temple and see that some of the walls and structures
are made of cloud

Posed the moral quandary by the door, all answered no to the deal.

Greeted and welcomed by Xolbi, who offers them rest and shelter.

Trio asked after Faurin, who Xolbi said they had met many years ago,
after an evil was defeated in the land. Implied some connection between
Faurin and Elydir, as Faurin was depressed at this point.

When read the prophecy, Xolbi chuckled and realised that the characters
had misinterpreted the "divine slopes", expressing their knowledge of
where it is but will do a trade instead. Find the stolen crown and
return it. The crown is in a thieves lair in Ironwood Street in
Renauru. Xolbi also shows the party a glyph left by the thief.

Xolbi shows off.

Xolbi teleports the trio to the Temple of Ilmater in Renaura, giving
them the glyphs for his teleportation circle at the Temple of Torm.

Greeted by a force of guards, who let them pass, with Wurcon greeting
them in the temple.

Aseir speaks to Glanna, and is rejected

Trio travel to Ironstreet, find their way to the hideout, Meriele using
the glyph that was shown to the party by Xolbi, reading it as "Spider's
Claw". Elmon knocked on the door convinced the awake guard inside that
the players wanted to buy the crown and was welcomed in. The guard who
let the players in, woke the other guard, and sent the other guard to
get the Spider's Claw.

The guard tried to steal money from Meriele, cutting her purse. The
party used this to threaten the guard into letting them into the vault.

Solved the puzzle in the vault, forcing the guard to try to move the
glass orb first, and then tying themselves to each other using rope and
passing along the orb between each other.

They get into the vault, taking the money, art items, and the crown.
Wurcon teleports them back to the Temple of Torm.

Xolbi thanks them for getting the crown, gives them the information
about where and when to find a portal (tonight) to Mount Celestia, and
how to get there and provided a promise of further help by keeping the
weather calm.

Trio travel up the mountain, helping a monk on the way up, putting the
monk on the horse to help him up the hill. When they reached the top,
they had an hour or so until the moon was right overhead. When the moon
was overhead, the wind calmed, the air felt summery, and a silver pool
appeared at the top of the mountain. The monk reveals himself to be a
Deva, thanks the players for their help and lets the pass into the
portal.

Players jump into the silvery pool together, falling 20ft into a
large silvery sea, in the distance seeing an impossibly large mountain.
Though it's night, the moon and starlight fills the sky. The trio can
see boats near-ish on the silvery sea. The horse is panicking in the
water.
