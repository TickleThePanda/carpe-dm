## The recurring dream

> Nim and Prince Aseir, you have been having recurring dreams recently;
> not every night, but every few nights. The dreams always start with
> you woken up suddenly by an ageing elven woman. With her help, you
> flee a different horror or are drawn by the promise of reward to a
> distant tower.
>
> Tall and alone, the unadorned tower stands in an almost barren valley.
> Its stonework is slotted together; each stone taller than a human but
> placed no further apart than a fingernail.
>
> You're brought to the base of the tower, where there's the outline of
> a doorway carved in the stone of the building, facing the bottom of
> the valley. It's here she speaks the final words to you <q>**LINE OF
> RIDDLE**. There are two others. They will help. Meet them there.</q>
>
> The dreams end there.  Some of the specifics fade, but you can still
> remember the way to the tower and women who helps you.
>
> Elmon, you received a letter from a friend, somebody who you trust,
> that invites you to travel to this location - you have the letter with
> you.
>
> Attracted by these, you've travelled to this location.
>
> You have all, making your own journeys, finally arrived. The cold,
> drizzle, and blustery wind fight through your clothes, chilling you.
> You can smell the musk of the heather and peat. You arrived at
> different times over the last few days, Nim, then Prince Aseir, then
> Elmon.

## Locations

### The tower

The tower is as Nim and Prince Aseir saw in their dreams: tall, standing
at around 130ft, it narrows slightly as it goes towards the top. There's
no decoration and no windows. The unweathered stone is smooth to touch. 

The door faces towards the entrance of the valley and is easy to find.

If a character uses detect magic, they will discover that there is an
Abjuration field in the 

#### The door

> Although the rest of the tower lacks decoration, carved into the stone
> is the shape of a huge door. Above the door, you can see runes making
> up 5 words that you do not recognise and cannot read.

Anybody who tries to work out which language it is and makes a
successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check discovers that the
language is **LOST LANGUAGE**, a lost language. If the language can be
understood, it reads: <q>Safe we keep her. Allow no will.</q> The
original intent, however, was: <q>This keeps us safe from her, do not
free her.</q>

To enter, the characters must speak the word *unbind* or *free*.

#### Entering the tower

> The stones making up the doorway turn to a bright light. The light
> fades, revealing a short passage into the tower. The passage leads to
> a brightly lit landing; glass half-bowls filled with flame on the
> walls.  From here, stairs spiral upwards, starting on your right.
> Apart from this, the landing is empty.

The passage stays open after everybody walks in.

The stairway follows up and around, eventually reaching a landing with a
door on the left - facing the centre of the tower.

The lamps are made with *Continual Flame*.

#### Reaching the study

> After you open the door, you see a large circular room before you. The
> same torches as before light it. Luxurious furniture is sparsely
> spread around the room, although its style is unlike anything you've
> seen before.
>  
> On the left wall, there's a four-poster-bed with a chest sitting at
> the end, and large wardrobe to the side of the bed. On the opposite
> side, a huge bookcase is crammed with scrolls and books. In the centre
> of the room is a large table that's dressed with food. Closest to you
> is a desk facing the door. The smell of incense fills the room.
>
> Sitting at the desk is a woman: her hair grey and face wrinkled,
> pointed ears poke out under a circlet with a ruby gemstone set, and
> her robes are a deep dark red with intricate symbols laced in a golden
> thread.
>
> Noticing you arriving, she smiles towards you and stands, gesturing
> you into the room towards the table.
>  
> <q>Ah! I see that you managed to solve my riddle. Please, come in.</q>

Here, the woman introduces herself as *QUEST GIVER*. She offers the
characters food and drink, and if they accept, food will appear at the
table.

She will explain that her quest is to have her stolen amulet retrieved.
She's chosen them because it was taken from her a long time ago and it's
likely to be a perilous journey to retrieve it. The amulet is in the
*Tomb of *TOMB NAME**, which is close to *the City of *CITY** which is a
2 day journey from here, across the moors. She doesn't know where the
tomb is.

She will give the adventurers an very old map and some food supplies for
3 days travel.

The map looks as follows: 

```
 ~  ~   @ @@@@@ ^ ^
   x  ~  @@@@   ^^^ ^
~  ~ ~   +-----O ^^
  ~     / @@@ ^ ^  ^
~      / ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
 ~    /   ^^^ ^
```

### Travel to the City of *CITY*

To see how quickly the adventurers get through the city to the, the
characters can take a DC 20 Survival (Wisdom) check. On a:
 - *success*, the journey takes 24 hours, with 1 night's rest. The first
   day gets them to the road. The second day gets them to the city in
   the afternoon. 
 - *failure*, the journey takes 48 hours, with 2 nights' rest. The first
   day is spent being lost in the wilderness. The second day gets them
   to the road. The third day gets them to the city in the afternoon.

General environment: Moor-wilderness → Road in the moors → Road through
hilly-forest → Road through hilly-forest broken up by pastures
(mountains and city in distance)

### City of *CITY*

#### From a distance

> Nestled in a steep valley is a small city: the valley's impassable
> natural walls overshadowing the natural ones. There's a castle
> burrowed into the top reaches where the surrounding mountains draw
> closest. A single gatehouse guards the walls that span the bottom of
> the steep valley.

#### Approaching the city

> As you approach the city, you can see that the walls scarred and worn,
> some newer stonework replaces sections.
>
> A steady flow of people are passing in and out of the gates. A couple
> of bored looking guards standing on either side, almost ignoring the
> small rabble.

Anyone who wants to know the history of the city and makes a successful
DC 15 Intelligence (History) check knows that it's an ancient city that
was, through sheer force of will, invaded over 300 years ago, the old
royal family was forced into marriage into the new lords.

The guards give the characters no trouble entering the city.

#### Entering the gates

> You've passed through the city gates. A busy main street climbs up.
> Behind the stone houses that are set against the mountainside, you can
> see the tops of the castle's towers.
> 
> The street, leading to the city's square, is lined with an assortment
> of busy market stalls. Farmers and merchants are bartering. A
> procession of robed figures part the crowd, walking away from you
> towards the centre of the city. Guards wander, chatting with
> merchants, watching the stalls.

Here the characters have a whole range of options for finding out where
the tomb is:
 - merchants will point the characters towards *The Dragon's Claw* which
   is <q>just up the road - the bar-keep there talks about mad things
   like this</q>, if they're convinced by the characters
 - guards will point the characters towards the castle (and more
   specifically the castle library), if they're convinced by the
   characters
 - priests will welcome the characters to join their procession to the
   temple where the scholarly acolytes might know of such a place
 - general populace will be relatively helpful, pointing the characters
   straight to *The Dragon's Claw*

#### Temple of *TEMPLE NAME*

> In the centre of the city's square, there's a large round building.
> Outside, there's a statue of a bound man on his knees weeping. The
> figure is scarred and his limbs are at unsettling angles. On it, in
> common, is inscribed:
>
>> We welcome all to the house of Ilmater.

At the temple, the characters will be encouraged by a greeter, who will
introduce themselves as *GREETER NAME*, to pray.

The temple has a *TEMPLE SCHOLOR* scholar that knows of the local tombs.
*GREETER NAME* will take the characters to the her in the "records" room
further in the temple.

> *GREETER NAME* pushes a small door open that takes you into a small
> room small room, only a few feet wide, lit by candles. The room has a
> few bookcases in it, with scrolls and tomes on their shelves.
> 
> Despite you entering the room rather loudly, a young woman who is
> hunched at the desk, has not looked up from the scroll she was
> reading. Next to her is a discarded plate of bread and cheese.
>
> "*TEMPLE SCHOLOR*. *TEMPLE SCHOLOR*? *TEMPLE SCHOLOR*! Hey! We have
> some travellers looking for some information about a nearby Tomb and I
> was hoping you could help them."
>
> It seems to take her a little to return to the world from the text,
> and she still glances back to it.

The scholar will help the characters but won't do it gladly. She will be
sharp with them and not really going too much out of her way to give
them information.

The scholar, sighing, will find a map and will point the characters to
the correct place on a map. She knows a little of the history of the
tombs.

> This is to Tomb of *TOMB NAME* where the old Lords, *IMPRISONING
> PARTY* buried, from before our current Lords, *CURRENT LORDS* came
> here. Unfortunately - we those who worship Ilmater (the God of
> Endurance) - we're not that good at keeping detailed records of
> history.
>
> From my study of our small collection of histories, I can tell you
> that their rule was tumultuous. There were different powers at play
> within the city leaders and part of that lead to their declining power
> and, ultimately, their family relying on the support and marriage with
> *CURRENT LORDS* to maintain any form of power.
>
> I'm sorry I can't be any more helpful with the details here.
>
> You're welcome to read through the books on history that we have here
> but I don't think you'll find much more than I've given you. If you do
> choose to do so, I'd prefer for you to go elsewhere so as not to cause
> any more distraction to me.

#### The Dragon's Claw

> Fighting away the cold, a roaring fire crackles. The funk of pipe weed
> smoke and stale beer linger. There are a few people sitting around the
> inn: a small group of younger men are playing dice, a hooded figure
> watching the door from an alcove, a woman hunched at the bar.
>
> Behind the bar a balding man with silver hair is cleaning tankards.

At the inn, the bar-keep will very gladly welcome the characters to sit
at the almost-empty bar and to have a drink. He will gladly tell mildly
accurate stories about a nearby tomb.

> I don't know of the Tomb of *TOMB NAME* but there is an old tomb
> outside the city. The old Lords of this city are buried there.
>
> Ooooohhh, there's lots of rumours about this place. Some people say
> it's haunted by a ghost sworn to protect it. Others say that the dead
> themselves walk the halls. I know that a scholar from the castle
> library went there recently never to return.
>
> I doubt it's *the dead* that got her, though. Much more likely that
> it's the goblins that use the place as a hide-out. I know that's not a
> rumour! They don't really cause a problem to the people in the city so
> the Lord here hasn't done anything about them.

He continues to ramble about the troubles that the goblins cause to the
farmers.

#### The castle's library

> As your tiring journey takes you higher up the city, closer to the
> castle, the  become closer together, making the city narrower. Closest
> to the castle, the path follows the side of one of the valley walls
> with large mansions on the other side.
>
> Eventually, you pass the last building and ahead of you are the walls
> to the castle. These walls stretch across the valley from one side to
> another, though that space is now only 50 ft.
>
> Behind the walls you can see a stone castle with two towers at the
> front. Layers continue behind it, each one building on the mountain's
> incline.
>
> The path takes you to the centre of this wall to a gatehouse. There
> are 4 guards standing at this entrance. They are suspicious of the
> characters and will not want to let them through the gate.

They can be, amongst other things:
 - bribed for 20gp
 - intimidated DC 20
 - persuaded DC 25

The characters will be let into the castle on the condition of being
escorted.

> The guard takes you through the gate into a courtyard and gardens, the
> castle about 60ft away from you. In the centre is a fountain, although
> there's no water flowing.
>
> Here, you can only see the front of the castle, a round tower built up
> against the walls of the mountain. Large carved wooden doors are
> closed at the front, a guard standing on either side.
>
> There's almost a direct path along the middle towards the wooden doors
> but the guard takes you around to the right, following the valley's
> wall, taking you to a smaller side entrance with little ornamentation.
>
> You're taken through some narrow stone servant corridors through to a
> library, just off a well decorated main corridor.
>
> The large room is filled with books and scrolls. Every accessible
> *inch* of the room is taken up by shelves with the narrowest of spaces
> between them.
>
> A man dressed in robes is moving books to what somebody *might* call a
> desk, although it could just be more storage.
>
> He happily gasps as you walk in, smiling.

He will explain to the players about the tomb's location and how to get
there, although that they don't know much about it now - *NAME OF MAD
LORD* a few generations ago demanded the burning of anything about the
*IMPRISONING PARTY*. He will explain that one of his apprentices went
there a few weeks ago but never returned, which he sounds very sad
about. He will ask them to see if they can find this apprentice.

### Travelling to the Tomb of *TOMB NAME*

When they reach the path, depending on what information they know.

> The old road is not easy to find - the forest reclaiming it. On each
> side of the path, a couple of stone sentinels are crumbling.
> Undergrowth covers the path and bushes are growing between the stones.

Players with a passive perception above 13 will see goblin tracks
heading along the path.

> For about an hour, the path continues overgrown, getting steeper. It
> ends where the mountain rises, a collapsed door in front of you.


### Tomb of *TOMB NAME*

<img class="map" alt="A map of the Tomb of *TOMB NAME*" src="/images/maps/unbound_tomb.png">

#### Entrance to the tomb

> At the foot of the mountain is the collapsed door.

There's a gap large enough for small creatures at the bottom, or medium
creatures with a successful Dexterity check of 15.

Some of the rubble can be shifted instead, with a successful Strength
check of 15 but it will cause some of the remaining rubble to collapse
and the goblins to be prepared

The rubble can also be climbed over with a successful Strength check of
15.

#### Goblin hideout

 - Stench of goblins
 - If the goblins know the characters are there, then they're silent.
   Otherwise, laughing and arguing can be heard.
 - Room has wooden structures that some goblins might hide behind
 - Goblins will try to ambush the players, if they know the players are
   there

---

 - Levers need to be in the right order to open the door. *HOW*

#### Grand corridor

> There's grand corridor carved out of the stone. Torches of a similar
> design from *QUEST GIVER*'s tower adorn the walls, fire flickering out
> of them. The corridor is about 200ft long and about 10ft wide. You
> can see 3 corridors off the left hand wall and 2 off the right hand
> wall - these are built at odd intervals. The space in here is almost
> pristine, apart from dust. The grand doors that are at the end of the
> corridor are open.

The smaller corridors as the characters go along:
 1. a corridor on the right, it's about 70ft long.
 2. a corridor on the left, it's about 90ft long.
 3. a short corridor on the right, and then a door
 4. a short corridor on the left, and then a door
 5. a short corridor on the right, and then a door

#### Tomb of Lord *LORD NAME*

> Coming through the main doors, an expansive vaulted room is before
> you. It's about 120ft long. In the centre of the room a large
> sarcophagus is built onto a stone platform with steps running up to
> it. A blue crystalline stone outcrop is right above the sarcophagus,
> casting weird flickering light from the torches around the room.
>
> Between the centre and each corner are 4 pillars. Each of these 4
> pillars intertwine to build up to the vaulted ceiling.
>
> Collapsed one of the pillars is a slashed and bloodied body wearing
> robes. A backpack lies on the floor before the engraving, its contents
> strewn.
>
> There is a large engraving on the ground in front of the players.

The backpack (and the area around the backpack) contains the following
supplies:
 - a hammer
 - 10 pitons
 - 10 torches
 - a tinderbox
 - 10 days of rations
 - a waterskin
 - 50ft of hempen rope
 - a scroll of *Comprehend Languages*

After two minutes in the room, the stone above the centre of the room
flashes a bright blue. Nothing happens for a couple of seconds until the
characters can hear the scraping of stone. The sarcophagus lids are
sliding open. Skeletons begin to climb out.

There are 11 skeletons.

#### The Lord's guard room

> 

If the players try to go through this room, 6 skeletons will leave their
sarcophagi to attack the players almost immediately.

#### Giant spider's chamber

#### Tomb of *IMPRISONER*

#### *STORAGE* ?

#### Locked door

#### Collapsed passageway

#### Hidden doorway

#### * Additional Tombs

Each contains 3 skeletons that will attack the players almost
immediately. In each of the tombs, the players will find 3d10 gold 

## Characters

### *QUEST GIVER*

## Random encounters

## Background

*QUEST GIVER* is an elven wizard that worked with *IMPRISONING PARTY*
but became powerful and corrupt, controlling the government and removing
anybody who got in her way.

What was left of the *IMPRISONING PARTY* convinced *IMPRISONER* agreed
to kill the *QUEST GIVER*. However, *IMPRISONER* was previously her
lover and instead of killing her, he instead imprisoned her in a warded
tower, taking her amulet, a family heirloom, as proof of killing her.
The warded tower would only allow her to leave if the amulet was
returned and the tower's doorway re-opened.

*IMPRISONER* had planned to later free *QUEST GIVER* from the tower,
when he discovered a way to strip the *QUEST GIVER* of her powers.

After *IMPRISONER* returned to the *IMPRISONING PARTY* with the amulet,
his victory celebrated. He spent the rest of his life in high regard
with the *IMPRISONING PARTY* as their family scholar. He spent much time
working in secret to find a way to free *QUEST GIVER* but to no avail.
Over time, he became a frustrated and bitter man, eventually resorting
to suicide. Still celebrated, he was buried with the family in the Tomb
of *TOMB NAME*, the amulet buried with him.

Despite his wish to leave the world, the *IMPRISONER*'s knowledge that
there is no hope of stripping the *QUEST GIVER* of her powers bound him
to the amulet to prevent anybody from ever returning it to her.

The *QUEST GIVER* has spent the last 500 years finding weaknesses in the
wards, using her powers to communicate to the outside world, planning
her recovery of the amulet and to escape, taking her revenge over the
descendants of the *IMPRISONING PARTY*.
