## Introduction - Recurring dream

<blockquote class="to-read">

  Nim and Prince Aseir, you have been having recurring dreams recently; not
  every night, but every few nights. The dreams always start with you woken up
  suddenly by an tall, thin, ageing woman. With her help, you flee a different
  horror or are drawn by the promise of reward to a distant tower.

  Tall and alone, the unadorned tower stands in an almost barren valley. Its
  stonework is slotted together; each stone taller than a human but placed no
  further apart than a fingernail.

  You're brought to the base of the tower, where there's the outline of a
  doorway carved in the stone of the building, facing the bottom of the valley.
  It's here she speaks the final words to you "**LINE OF RIDDLE**. There are
  two others.  They will help.  Meet them there."

  The dreams end there. Some of the specifics fade, but you can still remember
  the way to the tower and women who helps you.

  Elmon, you recieved a letter from a friend, somebody who you trust, that
  invites you to travel to this location - the letter expresses excitement over
  a odd rumour of an adventure that will become a great tale! It's such a shame
  that he can't go this time because he's "**LINE OF RIDDLE**".

  Attracted by these, you've travelled to this location.

  You have all, making your own journeys, finally arrived. The cold, drizzle,
  and blustery wind fight through your clothes, chilling you. You can smell the
  musk of the heather and peat. You arrived at different times over the last
  few days, Nim, then Prince Aseir, then Elmon.

## The Tower

The tower is as Nim and Prince Aseir saw in their dreams: tall, standing at
around 130ft, it narrows slightly as it goes towards the top. There's no
decoration and no windows. The unweathered stone is smooth to touch. 

The door faces towards the entrance of the valley and is easy to find.

### The Door

<blockquote class="to-read">

  The only decoration on the tower is the form of large doorway, carved into the
  stone - 17 feet high. Above the door, you can see runes making up 5 words that
  you do not recognise and cannot read.

</blockquote>

On a successful history check, <span class="check">15</span>, it can be
recognised as **LOST LANGUAGE**, a lost language. If the language can be
understood, it reads "Safe, we keep her. Allow no will." The original intent
was "This keeps us safe from her, do not free her."

To enter, the characters must speak the word "unbind" or "free".

### Entering the Tower

<blockquote class="to-read">

  The stones making up the doorway turn to a bright light. The light fades,
  revealing a short passage into the tower. The passage leads to a brightly lit
  landing; glass half-bowls filled with flame on the walls. From here, stairs
  spiral upwards, starting on your right. Apart from this, the landing is
  empty.

</blockquote>

The passage stays open after everybody walks in.

The stairway follows up and around, eventually reaching a landing with a door
on the left - facing the centre of the tower.

The lamps are made with "Continual Flame".

### Reaching the Study

<blockquote class="to-read">

  After the door opens, you can see into a large circular room. The same torches
  as before lighting it.

## Characters

### Artefact

 - Stored in a crumbling ruin which holds magical protections.
 - Artefact will provide the wearer, if they're a descendant of *A* with some
   powerful ablities. If it's not a descendant, it does very little.

## Behind the scenes

 - imprisoned being wishes to be freed, a milenia since he was put to sleep
 - reaching out to people and tricking them to free him
 - for him to leave:
    - the word "unbind" must be spoken at the door to free him
    - he must wear the amulet
