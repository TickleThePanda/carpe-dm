# Plot Hook - Recurring dream

You've been having similar dreams every few nights. Each dream always starts
with you woken up suddenly by an ageing man. With him, you flee a different
horror or are drawn by the promise of reward to a distant tower. Although you
remember how to get to this location and that the man helped you there, it's
never fully clear what transcends during the dream.

Tall and alone, the tower stands in a valley. Its girth larger than most
buildings. Its stonework is slotted together; each piece taller and wider than
the height of a man but no further apart than a fingernail.

The doorway that you are brought to by the man is only engraved into the stone
of the building, facing the enterance of the valley. He speaks a phrase to you
"*LINE OF RIDDLE*" and then tells you "The others will help, meet them there."

# The Tower

You have all reached the destination, although over a few days.

## The Door

There's some text above the door, but cannot be understood by anybody in the
party. On a successful history check, it can be recognised as a lost language. 

## Door puzzle

Riddle, answer "unbind"

# Artefact

 - Stored in a crumbling ruin which holds magical protections.
 - Artefact will provide the wearer, if they're a descendant of *A* with
 some powerful ablities. If it's not a descendant, it does very little.
